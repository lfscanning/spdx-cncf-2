            "description": "A helper to merge structs and maps in Golang. Useful for configuration default values, avoiding messy if-statements.\n\nMergo merges same-type structs and maps by setting default values in zero-value fields. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields. It will do recursively any exported one. It also won't merge structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nIt is ready for production use. It is used in several projects by Docker, Google, The Linux Foundation, VMWare, Shopify, etc.\n\n1.0.0\n\nIn 1.0.0 Mergo moves to a vanity URL `dario.cat/mergo`.\n\n0.3.9\n\nPlease keep in mind that a problematic PR broke 0.3.9. We reverted it in 0.3.10. We consider 0.3.10 as stable but not bug-free. . Also, this version adds suppot for go modules.\n\nKeep in mind that in 0.3.2, Mergo changed Merge() and Map() signatures to support transformers. We added an optional/variadic argument so that it won't break the existing code.\n\nIf you were using Mergo before April 6th, 2015, please check your project works as intended after updating your local copy with go get -u dario.cat/mergo. I apologize for any issue caused by its previous behavior and any future bug that Mergo could cause in existing projects after the change (release 0.2.0).\n\nDo your usual installation procedure:\n\nYou can only merge same-type structs with exported fields initialized as zero value of their type and same-types maps. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields but will do recursively any exported one. It won't merge empty structs value as they are zero values too. Also, maps will be merged recursively except for structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nAlso, you can merge overwriting values using the transformer WithOverride.\n\nAdditionally, you can map a map[string]interface{} to a struct (and otherwise, from struct to map), following the same restrictions as in Merge(). Keys are capitalized to find each corresponding exported field.\n\nWarning: if you map a struct to map, it won't do it recursively. Don't expect Mergo to map struct members of your struct as map[string]interface{}. They will be just assigned as values.\n\nHere is a nice example:\n\nTransformers allow to merge specific types differently than in the default behavior. In other words, now you can customize how some types are merged. For example, time.Time is a struct; it doesn't have zero value but IsZero can return true because it has fields with zero value. How can we merge a non-zero time.Time?\n\nIf I can help you, you have an idea or you are using Mergo in your projects, don't hesitate to drop me a line (or a pull request): https://twitter.com/im_dario\n\nWritten by Dario Casta\u00f1\u00e9: https://da.rio.hn\n\nBSD 3-Clause license, as Go language.",

            "description": "Package semver provides the ability to work with Semantic Versions (http://semver.org) in Go.\n\nSpecifically it provides the ability to:\n\nThere are two functions that can parse semantic versions. The `StrictNewVersion`\nfunction only parses valid version 2 semantic versions as outlined in the\nspecification. The `NewVersion` function attempts to coerce a version into a\nsemantic version and parse it. For example, if there is a leading v or a version\nlisted without all 3 parts (e.g. 1.2) it will attempt to coerce it into a valid\nsemantic version (e.g., 1.2.0). In both cases a `Version` object is returned\nthat can be sorted, compared, and used in constraints.\n\nWhen parsing a version an optional error can be returned if there is an issue\nparsing the version. For example,\n\nThe version object has methods to get the parts of the version, compare it to\nother versions, convert the version back into a string, and get the original\nstring. For more details please see the documentation\nat https://godoc.org/github.com/Masterminds/semver.\n\nA set of versions can be sorted using the `sort` package from the standard library.\nFor example,\n\nThere are two methods for comparing versions. One uses comparison methods on\n`Version` instances and the other is using Constraints. There are some important\ndifferences to notes between these two methods of comparison.\n\nThere are differences between the two methods or checking versions because the\ncomparison methods on `Version` follow the specification while comparison ranges\nare not part of the specification. Different packages and tools have taken it\nupon themselves to come up with range rules. This has resulted in differences.\nFor example, npm/js and Cargo/Rust follow similar patterns which PHP has a\ndifferent pattern for ^. The comparison features in this package follow the\nnpm/js and Cargo/Rust lead because applications using it have followed similar\npatters with their versions.\n\nChecking a version against version constraints is one of the most featureful\nparts of the package.\n\nThere are two elements to the comparisons. First, a comparison string is a list\nof comma or space separated AND comparisons. These are then separated by || (OR)\ncomparisons. For example, `\">= 1.2 < 3.0.0 || >= 4.2.3\"` is looking for a\ncomparison that's greater than or equal to 1.2 and less than 3.0.0 or is\ngreater than or equal to 4.2.3. This can also be written as\n`\">= 1.2, < 3.0.0 || >= 4.2.3\"`\n\nThe basic comparisons are:\n\nThere are multiple methods to handle ranges and the first is hyphens ranges.\nThese look like:\n\nThe `x`, `X`, and `*` characters can be used as a wildcard character. This works\nfor all comparison operators. When used on the `=` operator it falls\nback to the tilde operation. For example,\n\nTilde Range Comparisons (Patch)\n\nThe tilde (`~`) comparison operator is for patch level ranges when a minor\nversion is specified and major level changes when the minor number is missing.\nFor example,\n\nCaret Range Comparisons (Major)\n\nThe caret (`^`) comparison operator is for major level changes once a stable\n(1.0.0) release has occurred. Prior to a 1.0.0 release the minor versions acts\nas the API stability level. This is useful when comparisons of API versions as a\nmajor change is API breaking. For example,\n\nIn addition to testing a version against a constraint, a version can be validated\nagainst a constraint. When validation fails a slice of errors containing why a\nversion didn't meet the constraint is returned. For example,",

(https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\n### Containers\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\n### Filters\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\n### Container Filters\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\n### WebService Filters\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\n### Route Filters\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\n### Response Encoding\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\n### OPTIONS support\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\n### CORS\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUnexpected things happen. If a request cannot be processed because of a failure, your service needs to tell via the response what happened and why.\nFor this reason HTTP status codes exist and it is important to use the correct code in every exceptional situation.\n\nIf path or query parameters are not valid (content or type) then use http.StatusBadRequest.\n\nDespite a valid URI, the resource requested may not be available\n\nIf the application logic could not process the request (or write the response) then use http.StatusInternalServerError.\n\nThe request has a valid URL but the method (GET,PUT,POST,...) is not allowed.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Accept Header set for this operation.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Content-Type Header set for this operation.\n\n### ServiceError\n\nIn addition to setting the correct (error) Http status code, you can choose to write a ServiceError message on the response.\n\n### Performance options\n\nThis package has several options that affect the performance of your service. It is important to understand them and how you can change it.\n\nDoNotRecover controls whether panics will be caught to return HTTP 500.\nIf set to false, the container will recover from panics.\nDefault value is true\n\nIf content encoding is enabled then the default strategy for getting new gzip/zlib writers and readers is to use a sync.Pool.\nBecause writers are expensive structures, performance is even more improved when using a preloaded cache. You can also inject your own implementation.\n\n### Trouble shooting\n\nThis package has the means to produce detail logging of the complete Http request matching process and filter invocation.\nEnabling this feature requires you to set an implementation of restful.StdLogger (e.g. log.Logger) instance such as:\n\n### Logging\n\nThe restful.SetLogger() method allows you to override the logger used by the package. By default restful\nuses the standard library `log` package and logs to stdout. Different logging packages are supported as\nlong as they conform to `StdLogger` interface defined in the `log` sub-package, writing an adapter for your\npreferred package is simple.\n\n### Resources\n\n(c) 2012-2025, http://ernestmicklei.com.

(https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\n### Containers\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\n### Filters\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\n### Container Filters\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\n### WebService Filters\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\n### Route Filters\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\n### Response Encoding\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\n### OPTIONS support\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\n### CORS\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUnexpected things happen. If a request cannot be processed because of a failure, your service needs to tell via the response what happened and why.\nFor this reason HTTP status codes exist and it is important to use the correct code in every exceptional situation.\n\nIf path or query parameters are not valid (content or type) then use http.StatusBadRequest.\n\nDespite a valid URI, the resource requested may not be available\n\nIf the application logic could not process the request (or write the response) then use http.StatusInternalServerError.\n\nThe request has a valid URL but the method (GET,PUT,POST,...) is not allowed.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Accept Header set for this operation.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Content-Type Header set for this operation.\n\n### ServiceError\n\nIn addition to setting the correct (error) Http status code, you can choose to write a ServiceError message on the response.\n\n### Performance options\n\nThis package has several options that affect the performance of your service. It is important to understand them and how you can change it.\n\nDoNotRecover controls whether panics will be caught to return HTTP 500.\nIf set to false, the container will recover from panics.\nDefault value is true\n\nIf content encoding is enabled then the default strategy for getting new gzip/zlib writers and readers is to use a sync.Pool.\nBecause writers are expensive structures, performance is even more improved when using a preloaded cache. You can also inject your own implementation.\n\n### Trouble shooting\n\nThis package has the means to produce detail logging of the complete Http request matching process and filter invocation.\nEnabling this feature requires you to set an implementation of restful.StdLogger (e.g. log.Logger) instance such as:\n\n### Logging\n\nThe restful.SetLogger() method allows you to override the logger used by the package. By default restful\nuses the standard library `log` package and logs to stdout. Different logging packages are supported as\nlong as they conform to `StdLogger` interface defined in the `log` sub-package, writing an adapter for your\npreferred package is simple.\n\n### Resources\n\n(c) 2012-2025, http://ernestmicklei.com.

            "description": "Package logr defines a general-purpose logging API and abstract interfaces\nto back that API.  Packages in the Go ecosystem can depend on this package,\nwhile callers can implement logging with whatever backend is appropriate.\n\nLogging is done using a Logger instance.  Logger is a concrete type with\nmethods, which defers the actual logging to a LogSink interface.  The main\nmethods of Logger are Info() and Error().  Arguments to Info() and Error()\nare key/value pairs rather than printf-style formatted strings, emphasizing\n\"structured logging\".\n\nWith Go's standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr's structured logging, we'd write:\n\nErrors are much the same.  Instead of:\n\nWe'd write:\n\nInfo() and Error() are very similar, but they are separate methods so that\nLogSink implementations can choose to do things like attach additional\ninformation (such as stack traces) on calls to Error(). Error() messages are\nalways logged, regardless of the current verbosity.  If there is no error\ninstance available, passing nil is valid.\n\nOften we want to log information only when the application in \"verbose\nmode\".  To write log lines that are more verbose, Logger has a V() method.\nThe higher the V-level of a log line, the less critical it is considered.\nLog-lines with V-levels that are not enabled (as per the LogSink) will not\nbe written.  Level V(0) is the default, and logger.V(0).Info() has the same\nmeaning as logger.Info().  Negative V-levels have the same meaning as V(0).\nError messages do not have a verbosity level and are always logged.\n\nWhere we might have written:\n\nWe can write:\n\nLogger instances can have name strings so that all messages logged through\nthat instance have additional context.  For example, you might want to add\na subsystem name:\n\nThe WithName() method returns a new Logger, which can be passed to\nconstructors or other functions for further use.  Repeated use of WithName()\nwill accumulate name \"segments\".  These name segments will be joined in some\nway by the LogSink implementation.  It is strongly recommended that name\nsegments contain simple identifiers (letters, digits, and hyphen), and do\nnot contain characters that could muddle the log output or confuse the\njoining operation (e.g. whitespace, commas, periods, slashes, brackets,\nquotes, etc).\n\nLogger instances can store any number of key/value pairs, which will be\nlogged alongside all messages logged through that instance.  For example,\nyou might want to create a Logger instance per managed object:\n\nWith the standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr we'd write:\n\nLogger has very few hard rules, with the goal that LogSink implementations\nmight have a lot of freedom to differentiate.  There are, however, some\nthings to consider.\n\nThe log message consists of a constant message attached to the log line.\nThis should generally be a simple description of what's occurring, and should\nnever be a format string.  Variable information can then be attached using\nnamed values.\n\nKeys are arbitrary strings, but should generally be constant values.  Values\nmay be any Go value, but how the value is formatted is determined by the\nLogSink implementation.\n\nLogger instances are meant to be passed around by value. Code that receives\nsuch a value can call its methods without having to check whether the\ninstance is ready for use.\n\nThe zero logger (= Logger{}) is identical to Discard() and discards all log\nentries. Code that receives a Logger by value can simply call it, the methods\nwill never crash. For cases where passing a logger is optional, a pointer to Logger\nshould be used.\n\nKeys are not strictly required to conform to any specification or regex, but\nit is recommended that they:\n\nThese guidelines help ensure that log data is processed properly regardless\nof the log implementation.  For example, log implementations will try to\noutput JSON data or will store data for later database (e.g. SQL) queries.\n\nWhile users are generally free to use key names of their choice, it's\ngenerally best to avoid using the following keys, as they're frequently used\nby implementations:\n\nImplementations are encouraged to make use of these keys to represent the\nabove concepts, when necessary (for example, in a pure-JSON output form, it\nwould be necessary to represent at least message and timestamp as ordinary\nnamed values).\n\nImplementations may choose to give callers access to the underlying\nlogging implementation.  The recommended pattern for this is:\n\nLogger grants access to the sink to enable type assertions like this:\n\nCustom `With*` functions can be implemented by copying the complete\nLogger struct and replacing the sink in the copy:\n\nDon't use New to construct a new Logger with a LogSink retrieved from an\nexisting Logger.

            "description": "Package mapstructure exposes functionality to convert one arbitrary\nGo type into another, typically to convert a map[string]any\ninto a native Go structure.\n\nThe Go structure can be arbitrarily complex, containing slices,\nother structs, etc. and the decoder will properly decode nested\nmaps and so on into the proper structures in the native Go struct.\nSee the examples to see what the decoder is capable of.\n\nThe simplest function to start with is Decode.\n\nWhen decoding to a struct, mapstructure will use the field name by\ndefault to perform the mapping. For example, if a struct has a field\n\"Username\" then mapstructure will look for a key in the source value\nof \"username\" (case insensitive).\n\nYou can change the behavior of mapstructure by using struct tags.\nThe default struct tag that mapstructure looks for is \"mapstructure\"\nbut you can customize it using DecoderConfig.\n\nTo rename the key that mapstructure looks for, use the \"mapstructure\"\ntag and set a value directly. For example, to change the \"username\" example\nabove to \"user\":\n\nEmbedded structs are treated as if they're another field with that name.\nBy default, the two structs below are equivalent when decoding with\nmapstructure:\n\nThis would require an input that looks like below:\n\nIf your \"person\" value is NOT nested, then you can append \",squash\" to\nyour tag value and mapstructure will treat it as if the embedded struct\nwere part of the struct directly. Example:\n\nNow the following input would be accepted:\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to a map, the squash tag squashes the struct\nfields into a single map. Using the example structs from above:\n\nWill be decoded into a map:\n\nDecoderConfig has a field that changes the behavior of mapstructure\nto always squash embedded structs.\n\nIf there are any unmapped keys in the source value, mapstructure by\ndefault will silently ignore them. You can error by setting ErrorUnused\nin DecoderConfig. If you're using Metadata you can also maintain a slice\nof the unused keys.\n\nYou can also use the \",remain\" suffix on your tag to collect all unused\nvalues in a map. The field with this tag MUST be a map type and should\nprobably be a \"map[string]any\" or \"map[any]any\".\nSee example below:\n\nGiven the input below, Other would be populated with the other\nvalues that weren't used (everything but \"name\"):\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitempty\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to\nthe zero value, or a zero-length element. The zero value of all types is\nspecified in the Go specification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type. And likewise for the URLs field, if the\nslice is nil or empty, it won't be encoded into the destination type.\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitzero\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to the zero\nvalue. The zero value of all types is specified in the Go specification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type. And likewise for the URLs field, if the\nslice is nil, it won't be encoded into the destination type.\n\nNote that if the field is a slice, and it is empty but not nil, it will\nstill be encoded into the destination type.\n\nSince unexported (private) struct fields cannot be set outside the package\nwhere they are defined, the decoder will simply skip them.\n\nFor this output type definition:\n\nUsing this map as input:\n\nThe following struct will be decoded:\n\nTypes can implement the Unmarshaler interface to control their own decoding. The interface\nbehaves similarly to how UnmarshalJSON does in the standard library. It can be used as an\nalternative or companion to a DecodeHook.\n\nSee the Unmarshaler interface documentation for more details.\n\nmapstructure is highly configurable. See the DecoderConfig struct\nfor other features and options that are supported.",

            "description": "Package websocket implements the WebSocket protocol defined in RFC 6455.\n\nThe Conn type represents a WebSocket connection. A server application calls\nthe Upgrader.Upgrade method from an HTTP request handler to get a *Conn:\n\nCall the connection's WriteMessage and ReadMessage methods to send and\nreceive messages as a slice of bytes. This snippet of code shows how to echo\nmessages using these methods:\n\nIn above snippet of code, p is a []byte and messageType is an int with value\nwebsocket.BinaryMessage or websocket.TextMessage.\n\nAn application can also send and receive messages using the io.WriteCloser\nand io.Reader interfaces. To send a message, call the connection NextWriter\nmethod to get an io.WriteCloser, write the message to the writer and close\nthe writer when done. To receive a message, call the connection NextReader\nmethod to get an io.Reader and read until io.EOF is returned. This snippet\nshows how to echo messages using the NextWriter and NextReader methods:\n\nThe WebSocket protocol distinguishes between text and binary data messages.\nText messages are interpreted as UTF-8 encoded text. The interpretation of\nbinary messages is left to the application.\n\nThis package uses the TextMessage and BinaryMessage integer constants to\nidentify the two data message types. The ReadMessage and NextReader methods\nreturn the type of the received message. The messageType argument to the\nWriteMessage and NextWriter methods specifies the type of a sent message.\n\nIt is the application's responsibility to ensure that text messages are\nvalid UTF-8 encoded text.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol defines three types of control messages: close, ping\nand pong. Call the connection WriteControl, WriteMessage or NextWriter\nmethods to send a control message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received close messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetCloseHandler method and by returning a *CloseError from the\nNextReader, ReadMessage or the message Read method. The default close\nhandler sends a close message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received ping messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPingHandler method. The default ping handler sends a pong\nmessage to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received pong messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPongHandler method. The default pong handler does nothing.\nIf an application sends ping messages, then the application should set a\npong handler to receive the corresponding pong.\n\nThe control message handler functions are called from the NextReader,\nReadMessage and message reader Read methods. The default close and ping\nhandlers can block these methods for a short time when the handler writes to\nthe connection.\n\nThe application must read the connection to process close, ping and pong\nmessages sent from the peer. If the application is not otherwise interested\nin messages from the peer, then the application should start a goroutine to\nread and discard messages from the peer. A simple example is:\n\nConnections support one concurrent reader and one concurrent writer.\n\nApplications are responsible for ensuring that no more than one goroutine\ncalls the write methods (NextWriter, SetWriteDeadline, WriteMessage,\nWriteJSON, EnableWriteCompression, SetCompressionLevel) concurrently and\nthat no more than one goroutine calls the read methods (NextReader,\nSetReadDeadline, ReadMessage, ReadJSON, SetPongHandler, SetPingHandler)\nconcurrently.\n\nThe Close and WriteControl methods can be called concurrently with all other\nmethods.\n\nWeb browsers allow Javascript applications to open a WebSocket connection to\nany host. It's up to the server to enforce an origin policy using the Origin\nrequest header sent by the browser.\n\nThe Upgrader calls the function specified in the CheckOrigin field to check\nthe origin. If the CheckOrigin function returns false, then the Upgrade\nmethod fails the WebSocket handshake with HTTP status 403.\n\nIf the CheckOrigin field is nil, then the Upgrader uses a safe default: fail\nthe handshake if the Origin request header is present and the Origin host is\nnot equal to the Host request header.\n\nThe deprecated package-level Upgrade function does not perform origin\nchecking. The application is responsible for checking the Origin header\nbefore calling the Upgrade function.\n\nConnections buffer network input and output to reduce the number\nof system calls when reading or writing messages.\n\nWrite buffers are also used for constructing WebSocket frames. See RFC 6455,\nSection 5 for a discussion of message framing. A WebSocket frame header is\nwritten to the network each time a write buffer is flushed to the network.\nDecreasing the size of the write buffer can increase the amount of framing\noverhead on the connection.\n\nThe buffer sizes in bytes are specified by the ReadBufferSize and\nWriteBufferSize fields in the Dialer and Upgrader. The Dialer uses a default\nsize of 4096 when a buffer size field is set to zero. The Upgrader reuses\nbuffers created by the HTTP server when a buffer size field is set to zero.\nThe HTTP server buffers have a size of 4096 at the time of this writing.\n\nThe buffer sizes do not limit the size of a message that can be read or\nwritten by a connection.\n\nBuffers are held for the lifetime of the connection by default. If the\nDialer or Upgrader WriteBufferPool field is set, then a connection holds the\nwrite buffer only when writing a message.\n\nApplications should tune the buffer sizes to balance memory use and\nperformance. Increasing the buffer size uses more memory, but can reduce the\nnumber of system calls to read or write the network. In the case of writing,\nincreasing the buffer size can reduce the number of frame headers written to\nthe network.\n\nSome guidelines for setting buffer parameters are:\n\nLimit the buffer sizes to the maximum expected message size. Buffers larger\nthan the largest message do not provide any benefit.\n\nDepending on the distribution of message sizes, setting the buffer size to\na value less than the maximum expected message size can greatly reduce memory\nuse with a small impact on performance. Here's an example: If 99% of the\nmessages are smaller than 256 bytes and the maximum message size is 512\nbytes, then a buffer size of 256 bytes will result in 1.01 more system calls\nthan a buffer size of 512 bytes. The memory savings is 50%.\n\nA write buffer pool is useful when the application has a modest number\nwrites over a large number of connections. when buffers are pooled, a larger\nbuffer size has a reduced impact on total memory use and has the benefit of\nreducing system calls and frame overhead.\n\nPer message compression extensions (RFC 7692) are experimentally supported\nby this package in a limited capacity. Setting the EnableCompression option\nto true in Dialer or Upgrader will attempt to negotiate per message deflate\nsupport.\n\nIf compression was successfully negotiated with the connection's peer, any\nmessage received in compressed form will be automatically decompressed.\nAll Read methods will return uncompressed bytes.\n\nPer message compression of messages written to a connection can be enabled\nor disabled by calling the corresponding Conn method:\n\nCurrently this package does not support compression with \"context takeover\".\nThis means that messages must be compressed and decompressed in isolation,\nwithout retaining sliding window or dictionary state across messages. For\nmore details refer to RFC 7692.\n\nUse of compression is experimental and may result in decreased performance.",

            "description": "A helper to merge structs and maps in Golang. Useful for configuration default values, avoiding messy if-statements.\n\nMergo merges same-type structs and maps by setting default values in zero-value fields. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields. It will do recursively any exported one. It also won't merge structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nIt is ready for production use. It is used in several projects by Docker, Google, The Linux Foundation, VMWare, Shopify, etc.\n\nPlease keep in mind that a problematic PR broke 0.3.9. We reverted it in 0.3.10. We consider 0.3.10 as stable but not bug-free. . Also, this version adds suppot for go modules.\n\nKeep in mind that in 0.3.2, Mergo changed Merge() and Map() signatures to support transformers. We added an optional/variadic argument so that it won't break the existing code.\n\nIf you were using Mergo before April 6th, 2015, please check your project works as intended after updating your local copy with go get -u github.com/imdario/mergo. I apologize for any issue caused by its previous behavior and any future bug that Mergo could cause in existing projects after the change (release 0.2.0).\n\nDo your usual installation procedure:\n\nYou can only merge same-type structs with exported fields initialized as zero value of their type and same-types maps. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields but will do recursively any exported one. It won't merge empty structs value as they are zero values too. Also, maps will be merged recursively except for structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nAlso, you can merge overwriting values using the transformer WithOverride.\n\nAdditionally, you can map a map[string]interface{} to a struct (and otherwise, from struct to map), following the same restrictions as in Merge(). Keys are capitalized to find each corresponding exported field.\n\nWarning: if you map a struct to map, it won't do it recursively. Don't expect Mergo to map struct members of your struct as map[string]interface{}. They will be just assigned as values.\n\nHere is a nice example:\n\nTransformers allow to merge specific types differently than in the default behavior. In other words, now you can customize how some types are merged. For example, time.Time is a struct; it doesn't have zero value but IsZero can return true because it has fields with zero value. How can we merge a non-zero time.Time?\n\nIf I can help you, you have an idea or you are using Mergo in your projects, don't hesitate to drop me a line (or a pull request): https://twitter.com/im_dario\n\nWritten by Dario Casta\u00f1\u00e9: https://da.rio.hn\n\nBSD 3-Clause license, as Go language.",

            "description": "Package dns implements a full featured interface to the Domain Name System.\nBoth server- and client-side programming is supported. The package allows\ncomplete control over what is sent out to the DNS. The API follows the\nless-is-more principle, by presenting a small, clean interface.\n\nIt supports (asynchronous) querying/replying, incoming/outgoing zone transfers,\nTSIG, EDNS0, dynamic updates, notifies and DNSSEC validation/signing.\n\nNote that domain names MUST be fully qualified before sending them, unqualified\nnames in a message will result in a packing failure.\n\nResource records are native types. They are not stored in wire format. Basic\nusage pattern for creating a new resource record:\n\nOr directly from a string:\n\nOr when the default origin (.) and TTL (3600) and class (IN) suit you:\n\nOr even:\n\nIn the DNS messages are exchanged, these messages contain resource records\n(sets). Use pattern for creating a message:\n\nOr when not certain if the domain name is fully qualified:\n\nThe message m is now a message with the question section set to ask the MX\nrecords for the miek.nl. zone.\n\nThe following is slightly more verbose, but more flexible:\n\nAfter creating a message it can be sent. Basic use pattern for synchronous\nquerying the DNS at a server configured on 127.0.0.1 and port 53:\n\nSuppressing multiple outstanding queries (with the same question, type and\nclass) is as easy as setting:\n\nMore advanced options are available using a net.Dialer and the corresponding API.\nFor example it is possible to set a timeout, or to specify a source IP address\nand port to use for the connection:\n\nIf these \"advanced\" features are not needed, a simple UDP query can be sent,\nwith:\n\nWhen this functions returns you will get DNS message. A DNS message consists\nout of four sections.\nThe question section: in.Question, the answer section: in.Answer,\nthe authority section: in.Ns and the additional section: in.Extra.\n\nEach of these sections (except the Question section) contain a []RR. Basic\nuse pattern for accessing the rdata of a TXT RR as the first RR in\nthe Answer section:\n\nBoth domain names and TXT character strings are converted to presentation form\nboth when unpacked and when converted to strings.\n\nFor TXT character strings, tabs, carriage returns and line feeds will be\nconverted to \\t, \\r and \\n respectively. Back slashes and quotations marks will\nbe escaped. Bytes below 32 and above 127 will be converted to \\DDD form.\n\nFor domain names, in addition to the above rules brackets, periods, spaces,\nsemicolons and the at symbol are escaped.\n\nDNSSEC (DNS Security Extension) adds a layer of security to the DNS. It uses\npublic key cryptography to sign resource records. The public keys are stored in\nDNSKEY records and the signatures in RRSIG records.\n\nRequesting DNSSEC information for a zone is done by adding the DO (DNSSEC OK)\nbit to a request.\n\nSignature generation, signature verification and key generation are all supported.\n\nDynamic updates reuses the DNS message format, but renames three of the\nsections. Question is Zone, Answer is Prerequisite, Authority is Update, only\nthe Additional is not renamed. See RFC 2136 for the gory details.\n\nYou can set a rather complex set of rules for the existence of absence of\ncertain resource records or names in a zone to specify if resource records\nshould be added or removed. The table from RFC 2136 supplemented with the Go\nDNS function shows which functions exist to specify the prerequisites.\n\nThe prerequisite section can also be left empty. If you have decided on the\nprerequisites you can tell what RRs should be added or deleted. The next table\nshows the options you have and what functions to call.\n\nAn TSIG or transaction signature adds a HMAC TSIG record to each message sent.\nThe supported algorithms include: HmacSHA1, HmacSHA256 and HmacSHA512.\n\nBasic use pattern when querying with a TSIG name \"axfr.\" (note that these key names\nmust be fully qualified - as they are domain names) and the base64 secret\n\"so6ZGir4GPAqINNh9U5c3A==\":\n\nIf an incoming message contains a TSIG record it MUST be the last record in\nthe additional section (RFC2845 3.2).  This means that you should make the\ncall to SetTsig last, right before executing the query.  If you make any\nchanges to the RRset after calling SetTsig() the signature will be incorrect.\n\nWhen requesting an zone transfer (almost all TSIG usage is when requesting zone\ntransfers), with TSIG, this is the basic use pattern. In this example we\nrequest an AXFR for miek.nl. with TSIG key named \"axfr.\" and secret\n\"so6ZGir4GPAqINNh9U5c3A==\" and using the server 176.58.119.54:\n\nYou can now read the records from the transfer as they come in. Each envelope\nis checked with TSIG. If something is not correct an error is returned.\n\nA custom TSIG implementation can be used. This requires additional code to\nperform any session establishment and signature generation/verification. The\nclient must be configured with an implementation of the TsigProvider interface:\n\nBasic use pattern validating and replying to a message that has TSIG set.\n\nRFC 6895 sets aside a range of type codes for private use. This range is 65,280\n- 65,534 (0xFF00 - 0xFFFE). When experimenting with new Resource Records these\ncan be used, before requesting an official type code from IANA.\n\nSee https://miek.nl/2014/september/21/idn-and-private-rr-in-go-dns/ for more\ninformation.\n\nEDNS0 is an extension mechanism for the DNS defined in RFC 2671 and updated by\nRFC 6891. It defines a new RR type, the OPT RR, which is then completely\nabused.\n\nBasic use pattern for creating an (empty) OPT RR:\n\nThe rdata of an OPT RR consists out of a slice of EDNS0 (RFC 6891) interfaces.\nCurrently only a few have been standardized: EDNS0_NSID (RFC 5001) and\nEDNS0_SUBNET (RFC 7871). Note that these options may be combined in an OPT RR.\nBasic use pattern for a server to check if (and which) options are set:\n\nSIG(0)\n\nFrom RFC 2931:\n\nIt works like TSIG, except that SIG(0) uses public key cryptography, instead of\nthe shared secret approach in TSIG. Supported algorithms: ECDSAP256SHA256,\nECDSAP384SHA384, RSASHA1, RSASHA256 and RSASHA512.\n\nSigning subsequent messages in multi-message sessions is not implemented.",

            "description": "Package mapstructure exposes functionality to convert one arbitrary\nGo type into another, typically to convert a map[string]interface{}\ninto a native Go structure.\n\nThe Go structure can be arbitrarily complex, containing slices,\nother structs, etc. and the decoder will properly decode nested\nmaps and so on into the proper structures in the native Go struct.\nSee the examples to see what the decoder is capable of.\n\nThe simplest function to start with is Decode.\n\nWhen decoding to a struct, mapstructure will use the field name by\ndefault to perform the mapping. For example, if a struct has a field\n\"Username\" then mapstructure will look for a key in the source value\nof \"username\" (case insensitive).\n\nYou can change the behavior of mapstructure by using struct tags.\nThe default struct tag that mapstructure looks for is \"mapstructure\"\nbut you can customize it using DecoderConfig.\n\nTo rename the key that mapstructure looks for, use the \"mapstructure\"\ntag and set a value directly. For example, to change the \"username\" example\nabove to \"user\":\n\nEmbedded structs are treated as if they're another field with that name.\nBy default, the two structs below are equivalent when decoding with\nmapstructure:\n\nThis would require an input that looks like below:\n\nIf your \"person\" value is NOT nested, then you can append \",squash\" to\nyour tag value and mapstructure will treat it as if the embedded struct\nwere part of the struct directly. Example:\n\nNow the following input would be accepted:\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to a map, the squash tag squashes the struct\nfields into a single map. Using the example structs from above:\n\nWill be decoded into a map:\n\nDecoderConfig has a field that changes the behavior of mapstructure\nto always squash embedded structs.\n\nIf there are any unmapped keys in the source value, mapstructure by\ndefault will silently ignore them. You can error by setting ErrorUnused\nin DecoderConfig. If you're using Metadata you can also maintain a slice\nof the unused keys.\n\nYou can also use the \",remain\" suffix on your tag to collect all unused\nvalues in a map. The field with this tag MUST be a map type and should\nprobably be a \"map[string]interface{}\" or \"map[interface{}]interface{}\".\nSee example below:\n\nGiven the input below, Other would be populated with the other\nvalues that weren't used (everything but \"name\"):\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitempty\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to\nthe zero value. The zero value of all types is specified in the Go\nspecification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type.\n\nSince unexported (private) struct fields cannot be set outside the package\nwhere they are defined, the decoder will simply skip them.\n\nFor this output type definition:\n\nUsing this map as input:\n\nThe following struct will be decoded:\n\nmapstructure is highly configurable. See the DecoderConfig struct\nfor other features and options that are supported.",

It will\ntake a text input and produce a text output in HTML (or other format).\n\nA slightly more sophisticated way to use Blackfriday is to create a Markdown\nprocessor and to call Parse, which returns a syntax tree for the input\ndocument. You can leverage Blackfriday's parsing for content extraction from\nmarkdown documents. You can assign a custom renderer and set various options\nto the Markdown processor.\n\nIf you're interested in calling Blackfriday from command line, see\nhttps://github.com/russross/blackfriday-tool.\n\nBlackfriday includes an algorithm for creating sanitized anchor names\ncorresponding to a given input text. This algorithm is used to create\nanchors for headings when AutoHeadingIDs extension is enabled. The\nalgorithm is specified below, so that other packages can create\ncompatible anchor names and links to those anchors.\n\nThe algorithm iterates over the input text, interpreted as UTF-8,\none Unicode code point (rune) at a time. All runes that are letters (category L)\nor numbers (category N) are considered valid characters. They are mapped to\nlower case, and included in the output. All other runes are considered\ninvalid characters. Invalid characters that precede the first valid character,\nas well as invalid character that follow the last valid character\nare dropped completely. All other sequences of invalid characters\nbetween two valid characters are replaced with a single dash character '-'.\n\nSanitizedAnchorName exposes this functionality, and can be used to\ncreate compatible links to the anchor names generated by blackfriday.\nThis algorithm is also implemented in a small standalone package at\ngithub.com/shurcooL/sanitized_anchor_name. It can be useful for clients\nthat want a small package and don't need full functionality of blackfriday.",

You can use dot and array\nnotation too:\n\nOnce you have sought the `Value` you're interested in, you can use the `Is*` methods to determine its type.\n\nOr you can just assume the type, and use one of the strong type methods to extract the real value:\n\nIf there's no value there (or if it's the wrong type) then a default value will be returned,\nor you can be explicit about the default value.\n\nIf you're dealing with a slice of data as a value, Objx provides many useful methods for iterating,\nmanipulating and selecting that data.  You can find out more by exploring the index below.\n\nA simple example of how to use Objx:\n\nSince `objx.Map` is a `map[string]interface{}` you can treat it as such.\nFor example, to `range` the data, do what you would expect:",

This usually requires introduction of a new variable.\n\nmultierr includes AppendInto to simplify cases like this.\n\nThis will append the error into the err variable, and return true if that\nindividual error was non-nil.\n\nSee AppendInto for more information.\n\nGo makes it possible to modify the return value of a function in a defer\nblock if the function was using named returns. This makes it possible to\nrecord resource cleanup failures from deferred blocks.\n\nmultierr provides the Invoker type and AppendInvoke function to make cases\nlike the above simpler and obviate the need for a closure. The following is\nroughly equivalent to the example above.\n\nSee AppendInvoke and Invoker for more information.\n\nNOTE: If you're modifying an error from inside a defer, you MUST use a named\nreturn value for that function.\n\nErrors returned by Combine and Append MAY implement the following\ninterface.\n\nNote that if you need access to list of errors behind a multierr error, you\nshould prefer using the Errors function. That said, if you need cheap\nread-only access to the underlying errors slice, you can attempt to cast\nthe error to this interface. You MUST handle the failure case gracefully\nbecause errors returned by Combine and Append are not guaranteed to\nimplement this interface.",

            "description": "Package clientgo is the official Go client for the Kubernetes API. It provides\na standard set of clients and tools for building applications, controllers,\nand operators that communicate with a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nkubernetes: Contains the typed Clientset for interacting with built-in,\nversioned API objects (e.g., Pods, Deployments). This is the most common\nstarting point.\n\ndynamic: Provides a dynamic client that can perform operations on any\nKubernetes object, including Custom Resources (CRs). It is essential for\nbuilding controllers that work with CRDs.\n\ndiscovery: Used to discover the API groups, versions, and resources\nsupported by a Kubernetes cluster.\n\ntools/cache: The foundation of the controller pattern. This package provides\nefficient caching and synchronization mechanisms (Informers and Listers)\nfor building controllers.\n\ntools/clientcmd: Provides methods for loading client configuration from\nkubeconfig files. This is essential for out-of-cluster applications and CLI tools.\n\nrest: Provides a lower-level RESTClient that manages the details of\ncommunicating with the Kubernetes API server. It is useful for advanced\nuse cases that require fine-grained control over requests, such as working\nwith non-standard REST verbs.\n\nThere are two primary ways to configure a client to connect to the API server:\n\nIn-Cluster Configuration: For applications running inside a Kubernetes pod,\nthe `rest.InClusterConfig()` function provides a straightforward way to\nconfigure the client. It automatically uses the pod's service account for\nauthentication and is the recommended approach for controllers and operators.\n\nOut-of-Cluster Configuration: For local development or command-line tools,\nthe `clientcmd` package is used to load configuration from a\nkubeconfig file.\n\nThe `rest.Config` object allows for fine-grained control over client-side\nperformance and reliability. Key settings include:\n\nOnce configured, a client can be used to interact with objects in the cluster.\n\nThe Typed Clientset (`kubernetes` package) provides a strongly typed\ninterface for working with built-in Kubernetes objects.\n\nThe Dynamic Client (`dynamic` package) can work with any object, including\nCustom Resources, using `unstructured.Unstructured` types.\n\nFor Custom Resources (CRDs), the `k8s.io/code-generator` repository\ncontains the tools to generate typed clients, informers, and listers. The\n`sample-controller` is the canonical example of this pattern.\n\nServer-Side Apply is a patching strategy that allows multiple actors to\nshare management of an object by tracking field ownership. This prevents\nactors from inadvertently overwriting each other's changes and provides\na mechanism for resolving conflicts.

A\nReconciler implements a function which takes a reconcile Request containing\nthe name and namespace of the object to reconcile, reconciles the object,\nand returns a Response or an error indicating whether to requeue for a\nsecond round of processing.\n\nReconcilers use Clients (pkg/client) to access API objects.  The default\nclient provided by the manager reads from a local shared cache (pkg/cache)\nand writes directly to the API server, but clients can be constructed that\nonly talk to the API server, without a cache.  The Cache will auto-populate\nwith watched objects, as well as when other structured objects are\nrequested. The default split client does not promise to invalidate the cache\nduring writes (nor does it promise sequential create/get coherence), and code\nshould not assume a get immediately following a create/update will return\nthe updated resource. Caches may also have indexes, which can be created via\na FieldIndexer (pkg/client) obtained from the manager.  Indexes can be used to\nquickly and easily look up all objects with certain fields set.  Reconcilers\nmay retrieve event recorders (pkg/recorder) to emit events using the\nmanager.\n\nClients, Caches, and many other things in Kubernetes use Schemes\n(pkg/scheme) to associate Go types to Kubernetes API Kinds\n(Group-Version-Kinds, to be specific).\n\nSimilarly, webhooks (pkg/webhook/admission) may be implemented directly, but\nare often constructed using a builder (pkg/webhook/admission/builder).
