Like strings, any methods that perform modifications will not change the existing instance but instead return a new instance. For efficiency reasons, the implementation uses a sharing mechanism to ensure that newly created instances share as much data as possible with the previous instance while ensuring that operations have a predictable time complexity.\n\nThe System.Collections.Immutable library is built-in as part of the shared framework in .NET Runtime. The package can be installed when you need to use it in other target frameworks.",

See https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go#section-directories for a\nfull list of sub-modules.\n\nAll clients in sub-packages are configurable via client options. These options\nare described here: https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/option.\n\nEndpoint configuration is used to specify the URL to which requests are\nsent. It is used for services that support or require regional endpoints, as\nwell as for other use cases such as testing against fake servers.\n\nFor example, the Vertex AI service recommends that you configure the endpoint to\nthe location with the features you want that is closest to your physical\nlocation or the location of your users. There is no global endpoint for Vertex\nAI. See Vertex AI - Locations for more details. The following example\ndemonstrates configuring a Vertex AI client with a regional endpoint:\n\nAll of the clients support authentication via Google Application Default Credentials,\nor by providing a JSON key file for a Service Account. See examples below.\n\nGoogle Application Default Credentials (ADC) is the recommended way to authorize\nand authenticate clients. For information on how to create and obtain\nApplication Default Credentials, see\nhttps://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production. If you have your\nenvironment configured correctly you will not need to pass any extra information\nto the client libraries. Here is an example of a client using ADC to\nauthenticate:\n\nYou can use a file with credentials to authenticate and authorize, such as a\nJSON key file associated with a Google service account. Service Account keys can\nbe created and downloaded from https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts.\nThis example uses the Secret Manger client, but the same steps apply to the\nall other client libraries this package as well. Example:\n\nIn some cases (for instance, you don't want to store secrets on disk), you can\ncreate credentials from in-memory JSON and use the WithCredentials option.\nThis example uses the Secret Manager client, but the same steps apply to\nall other client libraries as well. Note that scopes can be\nfound at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes, and\nare also provided in all auto-generated libraries: for example,\ncloud.google.com/go/secretmanager/apiv1 provides DefaultAuthScopes. Example:\n\nBy default, non-streaming methods, like Create or Get, will have a default\ndeadline applied to the context provided at call time, unless a context deadline\nis already set. Streaming methods have no default deadline and will run\nindefinitely. To set timeouts or arrange for cancellation, use\ncontext. Transient errors will be retried when correctness allows.\n\nHere is an example of setting a timeout for an RPC using\ncontext.WithTimeout:\n\nHere is an example of setting a timeout for an RPC using\ngithub.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2.WithTimeout:\n\nHere is an example of how to arrange for an RPC to be canceled, use\ncontext.WithCancel:\n\nDo not attempt to control the initial connection (dialing) of a service by\nsetting a timeout on the context passed to NewClient. Dialing is non-blocking,\nso timeouts would be ineffective and would only interfere with credential\nrefreshing, which uses the same context.\n\nRegardless of which transport is used, request headers can be set in the same\nway using [`callctx.SetHeaders`]setheaders.\n\nHere is a generic example:\n\nThere are a some header keys that Google reserves for internal use that must\nnot be ovewritten. The following header keys are broadly considered reserved\nand should not be conveyed by client library users unless instructed to do so:\n\n* `x-goog-api-client`\n* `x-goog-request-params`\n\nBe sure to check the individual package documentation for other service-specific\nreserved headers. For example, Storage supports a specific auditing header that\nis mentioned in that [module's documentation]storagedocs.\n\nGoogle Cloud services respect system parameterssystem parameters that can be\nused to augment request and/or response behavior. For the most part, they are\nnot needed when using one of the enclosed client libraries. However, those that\nmay be necessary are made available via the [`callctx`]callctx package. If not\npresent there, consider opening an issue on that repo to request a new constant.\n\nConnection pooling differs in clients based on their transport. Cloud\nclients either rely on HTTP or gRPC transports to communicate\nwith Google Cloud.\n\nCloud clients that use HTTP rely on the underlying HTTP transport to cache\nconnections for later re-use. These are cached to the http.MaxIdleConns\nand http.MaxIdleConnsPerHost settings in http.DefaultTransport by default.\n\nFor gRPC clients, connection pooling is configurable. Users of Cloud Client\nLibraries may specify google.golang.org/api/option.WithGRPCConnectionPool\nas a client option to NewClient calls. This configures the underlying gRPC\nconnections to be pooled and accessed in a round robin fashion.\n\nMinimal container images like Alpine lack CA certificates. This causes RPCs to\nappear to hang, because gRPC retries indefinitely. See\nhttps://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/928 for more information.\n\nFor tips on how to write tests against code that calls into our libraries check\nout our Debugging Guide.\n\nFor tips on how to write tests against code that calls into our libraries check\nout our Testing Guide.\n\nMost of the errors returned by the generated clients are wrapped in an\ngithub.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2/apierror.APIError and can be further unwrapped\ninto a google.golang.org/grpc/status.Status or\ngoogle.golang.org/api/googleapi.Error depending on the transport used to make\nthe call (gRPC or REST).

This will\nsend requests to that address instead of to Cloud Storage. You can then create\nand use a client as usual:\n\nPlease note that there is no official emulator for Cloud Storage.\n\nA Google Cloud Storage bucket is a collection of objects. To work with a\nbucket, make a bucket handle:\n\nA handle is a reference to a bucket. You can have a handle even if the\nbucket doesn't exist yet. To create a bucket in Google Cloud Storage,\ncall BucketHandle.Create:\n\nNote that although buckets are associated with projects, bucket names are\nglobal across all projects.\n\nEach bucket has associated metadata, represented in this package by\nBucketAttrs. The third argument to BucketHandle.Create allows you to set\nthe initial BucketAttrs of a bucket. To retrieve a bucket's attributes, use\nBucketHandle.Attrs:\n\nAn object holds arbitrary data as a sequence of bytes, like a file. You\nrefer to objects using a handle, just as with buckets, but unlike buckets\nyou don't explicitly create an object. Instead, the first time you write\nto an object it will be created. You can use the standard Go io.Reader\nand io.Writer interfaces to read and write object data:\n\nObjects also have attributes, which you can fetch with ObjectHandle.Attrs:\n\nListing objects in a bucket is done with the BucketHandle.Objects method:\n\nObjects are listed lexicographically by name. To filter objects\nlexicographically, [Query.StartOffset] and/or [Query.EndOffset] can be used:\n\nIf only a subset of object attributes is needed when listing, specifying this\nsubset using Query.SetAttrSelection may speed up the listing process:\n\nBoth objects and buckets have ACLs (Access Control Lists). An ACL is a list of\nACLRules, each of which specifies the role of a user, group or project. ACLs\nare suitable for fine-grained control, but you may prefer using IAM to control\naccess at the project level (see Cloud Storage IAM docs.\n\nTo list the ACLs of a bucket or object, obtain an ACLHandle and call ACLHandle.List:\n\nYou can also set and delete ACLs.\n\nEvery object has a generation and a metageneration. The generation changes\nwhenever the content changes, and the metageneration changes whenever the\nmetadata changes. Conditions let you check these values before an operation;\nthe operation only executes if the conditions match. You can use conditions to\nprevent race conditions in read-modify-write operations.\n\nFor example, say you've read an object's metadata into objAttrs. Now\nyou want to write to that object, but only if its contents haven't changed\nsince you read it. Here is how to express that:\n\nYou can obtain a URL that lets anyone read or write an object for a limited time.\nSigning a URL requires credentials authorized to sign a URL. To use the same\nauthentication that was used when instantiating the Storage client, use\nBucketHandle.SignedURL.\n\nYou can also sign a URL without creating a client. See the documentation of\nSignedURL for details.\n\nA type of signed request that allows uploads through HTML forms directly to Cloud Storage with\ntemporary permission. Conditions can be applied to restrict how the HTML form is used and exercised\nby a user.\n\nFor more information, please see the XML POST Object docs as well\nas the documentation of BucketHandle.GenerateSignedPostPolicyV4.\n\nIf the GoogleAccessID and PrivateKey option fields are not provided, they will\nbe automatically detected by BucketHandle.SignedURL and\nBucketHandle.GenerateSignedPostPolicyV4 if any of the following are true:\n\nDetecting GoogleAccessID may not be possible if you are authenticated using a\ntoken source or using option.WithHTTPClient. In this case, you can provide a\nservice account email for GoogleAccessID and the client will attempt to sign\nthe URL or Post Policy using that service account.\n\nTo generate the signature, you must have:\n\nErrors returned by this client are often of the type github.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2/apierror.\nThe [apierror.APIError] type can wrap a google.golang.org/grpc/status.Status\nif gRPC was used, or a google.golang.org/api/googleapi.Error if HTTP/REST was used.\nYou might also encounter googleapi.Error directly from HTTP operations.\nThese types of errors can be inspected for more information by using errors.As\nto access the specific underlying error types and retrieve detailed information,\nincluding HTTP or gRPC status codes. For example:\n\nThis library may also return other errors that are not wrapped as [apierror.APIError]. For\nexample, errors with authentication may return cloud.google.com/go/auth.Error.\n\nMethods in this package may retry calls that fail with transient errors.\nRetrying continues indefinitely unless the controlling context is canceled, the\nclient is closed, or a non-transient error is received. To stop retries from\ncontinuing, use context timeouts or cancellation.\n\nThe retry strategy in this library follows best practices for Cloud Storage. By\ndefault, operations are retried only if they are idempotent, and exponential\nbackoff with jitter is employed. In addition, errors are only retried if they\nare defined as transient by the service. See the Cloud Storage retry docs\nfor more information.\n\nUsers can configure non-default retry behavior for a single library call (using\nBucketHandle.Retryer and ObjectHandle.Retryer) or for all calls made by a\nclient (using Client.SetRetry).

For example,\nto add a custom audit logging header:\n\nThis package includes support for the Cloud Storage gRPC API. This\nimplementation uses gRPC rather than the default JSON & XML APIs\nto make requests to Cloud Storage.

If all requirements are met, the client will\nuse Direct Connectivity by default without requiring any client options\nor environment variables. To disable Direct Connectivity, you can set\nthe environment variable GOOGLE_CLOUD_DISABLE_DIRECT_PATH=true.\n\nDependencies for the gRPC API may slightly increase the size of binaries for\napplications depending on this package. If you are not using gRPC, you can use\nthe build tag `disable_grpc_modules` to opt out of these dependencies and\nreduce the binary size.\n\nThe gRPC client is instrumented with Open Telemetry metrics which export to\nCloud Monitoring by default.

We reverted it in 0.3.10. We consider 0.3.10 as stable but not bug-free. . Also, this version adds suppot for go modules.\n\nKeep in mind that in 0.3.2, Mergo changed Merge() and Map() signatures to support transformers. We added an optional/variadic argument so that it won't break the existing code.\n\nIf you were using Mergo before April 6th, 2015, please check your project works as intended after updating your local copy with go get -u dario.cat/mergo. I apologize for any issue caused by its previous behavior and any future bug that Mergo could cause in existing projects after the change (release 0.2.0).\n\nDo your usual installation procedure:\n\nYou can only merge same-type structs with exported fields initialized as zero value of their type and same-types maps. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields but will do recursively any exported one. It won't merge empty structs value as they are zero values too. Also, maps will be merged recursively except for structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nAlso, you can merge overwriting values using the transformer WithOverride.\n\nAdditionally, you can map a map[string]interface{} to a struct (and otherwise, from struct to map), following the same restrictions as in Merge(). Keys are capitalized to find each corresponding exported field.\n\nWarning: if you map a struct to map, it won't do it recursively. Don't expect Mergo to map struct members of your struct as map[string]interface{}. They will be just assigned as values.\n\nHere is a nice example:\n\nTransformers allow to merge specific types differently than in the default behavior. In other words, now you can customize how some types are merged. For example, time.Time is a struct; it doesn't have zero value but IsZero can return true because it has fields with zero value. How can we merge a non-zero time.Time?\n\nIf I can help you, you have an idea or you are using Mergo in your projects, don't hesitate to drop me a line (or a pull request): https://twitter.com/im_dario\n\nWritten by Dario Casta\u00f1\u00e9: https://da.rio.hn\n\nBSD 3-Clause license, as Go language.",

Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields but will do recursively any exported one. It won't merge empty structs value as they are zero values too. Also, maps will be merged recursively except for structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nAlso, you can merge overwriting values using the transformer WithOverride.\n\nAdditionally, you can map a map[string]interface{} to a struct (and otherwise, from struct to map), following the same restrictions as in Merge(). Keys are capitalized to find each corresponding exported field.\n\nWarning: if you map a struct to map, it won't do it recursively. Don't expect Mergo to map struct members of your struct as map[string]interface{}. They will be just assigned as values.\n\nHere is a nice example:\n\nTransformers allow to merge specific types differently than in the default behavior. In other words, now you can customize how some types are merged. For example, time.Time is a struct; it doesn't have zero value but IsZero can return true because it has fields with zero value. How can we merge a non-zero time.Time?\n\nIf I can help you, you have an idea or you are using Mergo in your projects, don't hesitate to drop me a line (or a pull request): https://twitter.com/im_dario\n\nWritten by Dario Casta\u00f1\u00e9: https://da.rio.hn\n\nBSD 3-Clause license, as Go language.",

            "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

            "description": "Package semver provides the ability to work with Semantic Versions (http://semver.org) in Go.\n\nSpecifically it provides the ability to:\n\nThere are two functions that can parse semantic versions. The `StrictNewVersion`\nfunction only parses valid version 2 semantic versions as outlined in the\nspecification. The `NewVersion` function attempts to coerce a version into a\nsemantic version and parse it. For example, if there is a leading v or a version\nlisted without all 3 parts (e.g. 1.2) it will attempt to coerce it into a valid\nsemantic version (e.g., 1.2.0). In both cases a `Version` object is returned\nthat can be sorted, compared, and used in constraints.\n\nWhen parsing a version an optional error can be returned if there is an issue\nparsing the version. For example,\n\nThe version object has methods to get the parts of the version, compare it to\nother versions, convert the version back into a string, and get the original\nstring. For more details please see the documentation\nat https://godoc.org/github.com/Masterminds/semver.\n\nA set of versions can be sorted using the `sort` package from the standard library.\nFor example,\n\nThere are two methods for comparing versions. One uses comparison methods on\n`Version` instances and the other is using Constraints. There are some important\ndifferences to notes between these two methods of comparison.\n\nThere are differences between the two methods or checking versions because the\ncomparison methods on `Version` follow the specification while comparison ranges\nare not part of the specification. Different packages and tools have taken it\nupon themselves to come up with range rules. This has resulted in differences.\nFor example, npm/js and Cargo/Rust follow similar patterns which PHP has a\ndifferent pattern for ^. The comparison features in this package follow the\nnpm/js and Cargo/Rust lead because applications using it have followed similar\npatters with their versions.\n\nChecking a version against version constraints is one of the most featureful\nparts of the package.\n\nThere are two elements to the comparisons. First, a comparison string is a list\nof comma or space separated AND comparisons. These are then separated by || (OR)\ncomparisons. For example, `\">= 1.2 < 3.0.0 || >= 4.2.3\"` is looking for a\ncomparison that's greater than or equal to 1.2 and less than 3.0.0 or is\ngreater than or equal to 4.2.3. This can also be written as\n`\">= 1.2, < 3.0.0 || >= 4.2.3\"`\n\nThe basic comparisons are:\n\nThere are multiple methods to handle ranges and the first is hyphens ranges.\nThese look like:\n\nThe `x`, `X`, and `*` characters can be used as a wildcard character. This works\nfor all comparison operators. When used on the `=` operator it falls\nback to the tilde operation. For example,\n\nTilde Range Comparisons (Patch)\n\nThe tilde (`~`) comparison operator is for patch level ranges when a minor\nversion is specified and major level changes when the minor number is missing.\nFor example,\n\nCaret Range Comparisons (Major)\n\nThe caret (`^`) comparison operator is for major level changes once a stable\n(1.0.0) release has occurred. Prior to a 1.0.0 release the minor versions acts\nas the API stability level. This is useful when comparisons of API versions as a\nmajor change is API breaking. For example,\n\nIn addition to testing a version against a constraint, a version can be validated\nagainst a constraint. When validation fails a slice of errors containing why a\nversion didn't meet the constraint is returned. For example,",

            "description": "Package antlr implements the Go version of the ANTLR 4 runtime.\n\nANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing,\nor translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks.\nFrom a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build parse trees and also generates a listener interface\n(or visitor) that makes it easy to respond to the recognition of phrases of interest.\n\nAt version 4.11.x and prior, the Go runtime was not properly versioned for go modules. After this point, the runtime\nsource code to be imported was held in the `runtime/Go/antlr/v4` directory, and the go.mod file was updated to reflect the version of\nANTLR4 that it is compatible with (I.E. uses the /v4 path).\n\nHowever, this was found to be problematic, as it meant that with the runtime embedded so far underneath the root\nof the repo, the `go get` and related commands could not properly resolve the location of the go runtime source code.\nThis meant that the reference to the runtime in your `go.mod` file would refer to the correct source code, but would not\nlist the release tag such as @4.13.1 - this was confusing, to say the least.\n\nAs of 4.13.0, the runtime is now available as a go module in its own repo, and can be imported as `github.com/antlr4-go/antlr`\n(the go get command should also be used with this path). See the main documentation for the ANTLR4 project for more information,\nwhich is available at ANTLR docs. The documentation for using the Go runtime is available at Go runtime docs.\n\nThis means that if you are using the source code without modules, you should also use the source code in the new repo.\nThough we highly recommend that you use go modules, as they are now idiomatic for Go.\n\nI am aware that this change will prove Hyrum's Law, but am prepared to live with it for the common good.\n\nGo runtime author: Jim Idle jimi@idle.ws\n\nANTLR supports the generation of code in a number of target languages, and the generated code is supported by a\nruntime library, written specifically to support the generated code in the target language. This library is the\nruntime for the Go target.\n\nTo generate code for the go target, it is generally recommended to place the source grammar files in a package of\ntheir own, and use the `.sh` script method of generating code, using the go generate directive. In that same directory\nit is usual, though not required, to place the antlr tool that should be used to generate the code. That does mean\nthat the antlr tool JAR file will be checked in to your source code control though, so you are, of course, free to use any other\nway of specifying the version of the ANTLR tool to use, such as aliasing in `.zshrc` or equivalent, or a profile in\nyour IDE, or configuration in your CI system. Checking in the jar does mean that it is easy to reproduce the build as\nit was at any point in its history.\n\nHere is a general/recommended template for an ANTLR based recognizer in Go:\n\nMake sure that the package statement in your grammar file(s) reflects the go package the generated code will exist in.\n\nThe generate.go file then looks like this:\n\nAnd the generate.sh file will look similar to this:\n\ndepending on whether you want visitors or listeners or any other ANTLR options. Not that another option here\nis to generate the code into a\n\nFrom the command line at the root of your source package (location of go.mo)d) you can then simply issue the command:\n\nWhich will generate the code for the parser, and place it in the parsing package. You can then use the generated code\nby importing the parsing package.\n\nThere are no hard and fast rules on this. It is just a recommendation. You can generate the code in any way and to anywhere you like.\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2023 The ANTLR Project.

            "description": "Package sdk is the official AWS SDK for the Go programming language.\n\nThe AWS SDK for Go provides APIs and utilities that developers can use to\nbuild Go applications that use AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute\nCloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).\n\nThe SDK removes the complexity of coding directly against a web service\ninterface. It hides a lot of the lower-level plumbing, such as authentication,\nrequest retries, and error handling.\n\nThe SDK also includes helpful utilities on top of the AWS APIs that add additional\ncapabilities and functionality. For example, the Amazon S3 Download and Upload\nManager will automatically split up large objects into multiple parts and\ntransfer them concurrently.\n\nSee the s3manager package documentation for more information.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/s3/s3manager/\n\nCheckout the Getting Started Guide and API Reference Docs detailed the SDK's\ncomponents and details on each AWS client the SDK supports.\n\nThe Getting Started Guide provides examples and detailed description of how\nto get setup with the SDK.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/welcome.html\n\nThe API Reference Docs include a detailed breakdown of the SDK's components\nsuch as utilities and AWS clients. Use this as a reference of the Go types\nincluded with the SDK, such as AWS clients, API operations, and API parameters.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/\n\nThe SDK is composed of two main components, SDK core, and service clients.\nThe SDK core packages are all available under the aws package at the root of\nthe SDK. Each client for a supported AWS service is available within its own\npackage under the service folder at the root of the SDK.\n\naws - SDK core, provides common shared types such as Config, Logger,\nand utilities to make working with API parameters easier.\n\nawserr - Provides the error interface that the SDK will use for all\nerrors that occur in the SDK's processing. This includes service API\nresponse errors as well. The Error type is made up of a code and message.\nCast the SDK's returned error type to awserr.Error and call the Code\nmethod to compare returned error to specific error codes. See the package's\ndocumentation for additional values that can be extracted such as RequestId.\n\ncredentials - Provides the types and built in credentials providers\nthe SDK will use to retrieve AWS credentials to make API requests with.\nNested under this folder are also additional credentials providers such as\nstscreds for assuming IAM roles, and ec2rolecreds for EC2 Instance roles.\n\nendpoints - Provides the AWS Regions and Endpoints metadata for the SDK.\nUse this to lookup AWS service endpoint information such as which services\nare in a region, and what regions a service is in. Constants are also provided\nfor all region identifiers, e.g UsWest2RegionID for \"us-west-2\".\n\nsession - Provides initial default configuration, and load\nconfiguration from external sources such as environment and shared\ncredentials file.\n\nrequest - Provides the API request sending, and retry logic for the SDK.\nThis package also includes utilities for defining your own request\nretryer, and configuring how the SDK processes the request.\n\nservice - Clients for AWS services. All services supported by the SDK are\navailable under this folder.\n\nThe SDK includes the Go types and utilities you can use to make requests to\nAWS service APIs. Within the service folder at the root of the SDK you'll find\na package for each AWS service the SDK supports. All service clients follows\na common pattern of creation and usage.\n\nWhen creating a client for an AWS service you'll first need to have a Session\nvalue constructed. The Session provides shared configuration that can be shared\nbetween your service clients. When service clients are created you can pass\nin additional configuration via the aws.Config type to override configuration\nprovided by in the Session to create service client instances with custom\nconfiguration.\n\nOnce the service's client is created you can use it to make API requests the\nAWS service. These clients are safe to use concurrently.\n\nIn the AWS SDK for Go, you can configure settings for service clients, such\nas the log level and maximum number of retries. Most settings are optional;\nhowever, for each service client, you must specify a region and your credentials.\nThe SDK uses these values to send requests to the correct AWS region and sign\nrequests with the correct credentials. You can specify these values as part\nof a session or as environment variables.\n\nSee the SDK's configuration guide for more information.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html\n\nSee the session package documentation for more information on how to use Session\nwith the SDK.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/\n\nSee the Config type in the aws package for more information on configuration\noptions.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/#Config\n\nWhen using the SDK you'll generally need your AWS credentials to authenticate\nwith AWS services. The SDK supports multiple methods of supporting these\ncredentials. By default the SDK will source credentials automatically from\nits default credential chain. See the session package for more information\non this chain, and how to configure it. The common items in the credential\nchain are the following:\n\nEnvironment Credentials - Set of environment variables that are useful\nwhen sub processes are created for specific roles.\n\nShared Credentials file (~/.aws/credentials) - This file stores your\ncredentials based on a profile name and is useful for local development.\n\nEC2 Instance Role Credentials - Use EC2 Instance Role to assign credentials\nto application running on an EC2 instance. This removes the need to manage\ncredential files in production.\n\nCredentials can be configured in code as well by setting the Config's Credentials\nvalue to a custom provider or using one of the providers included with the\nSDK to bypass the default credential chain and use a custom one. This is\nhelpful when you want to instruct the SDK to only use a specific set of\ncredentials or providers.\n\nThis example creates a credential provider for assuming an IAM role, \"myRoleARN\"\nand configures the S3 service client to use that role for API requests.\n\nSee the credentials package documentation for more information on credential\nproviders included with the SDK, and how to customize the SDK's usage of\ncredentials.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/credentials\n\nThe SDK has support for the shared configuration file (~/.aws/config). This\nsupport can be enabled by setting the environment variable, \"AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1\",\nor enabling the feature in code when creating a Session via the\nOption's SharedConfigState parameter.\n\nIn addition to the credentials you'll need to specify the region the SDK\nwill use to make AWS API requests to. In the SDK you can specify the region\neither with an environment variable, or directly in code when a Session or\nservice client is created. The last value specified in code wins if the region\nis specified multiple ways.\n\nTo set the region via the environment variable set the \"AWS_REGION\" to the\nregion you want to the SDK to use. Using this method to set the region will\nallow you to run your application in multiple regions without needing additional\ncode in the application to select the region.\n\nThe endpoints package includes constants for all regions the SDK knows. The\nvalues are all suffixed with RegionID. These values are helpful, because they\nreduce the need to type the region string manually.\n\nTo set the region on a Session use the aws package's Config struct parameter\nRegion to the AWS region you want the service clients created from the session to\nuse. This is helpful when you want to create multiple service clients, and\nall of the clients make API requests to the same region.\n\nSee the endpoints package for the AWS Regions and Endpoints metadata.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/endpoints/\n\nIn addition to setting the region when creating a Session you can also set\nthe region on a per service client bases. This overrides the region of a\nSession. This is helpful when you want to create service clients in specific\nregions different from the Session's region.\n\nSee the Config type in the aws package for more information and additional\noptions such as setting the Endpoint, and other service client configuration options.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/#Config\n\nOnce the client is created you can make an API request to the service.\nEach API method takes a input parameter, and returns the service response\nand an error. The SDK provides methods for making the API call in multiple ways.\n\nIn this list we'll use the S3 ListObjects API as an example for the different\nways of making API requests.\n\nListObjects - Base API operation that will make the API request to the service.\n\nListObjectsRequest - API methods suffixed with Request will construct the\nAPI request, but not send it. This is also helpful when you want to get a\npresigned URL for a request, and share the presigned URL instead of your\napplication making the request directly.\n\nListObjectsPages - Same as the base API operation, but uses a callback to\nautomatically handle pagination of the API's response.\n\nListObjectsWithContext - Same as base API operation, but adds support for\nthe Context pattern. This is helpful for controlling the canceling of in\nflight requests. See the Go standard library context package for more\ninformation. This method also takes request package's Option functional\noptions as the variadic argument for modifying how the request will be\nmade, or extracting information from the raw HTTP response.\n\nListObjectsPagesWithContext - same as ListObjectsPages, but adds support for\nthe Context pattern. Similar to ListObjectsWithContext this method also\ntakes the request package's Option function option types as the variadic\nargument.\n\nIn addition to the API operations the SDK also includes several higher level\nmethods that abstract checking for and waiting for an AWS resource to be in\na desired state. In this list we'll use WaitUntilBucketExists to demonstrate\nthe different forms of waiters.\n\nWaitUntilBucketExists. - Method to make API request to query an AWS service for\na resource's state. Will return successfully when that state is accomplished.\n\nWaitUntilBucketExistsWithContext - Same as WaitUntilBucketExists, but adds\nsupport for the Context pattern. In addition these methods take request\npackage's WaiterOptions to configure the waiter, and how underlying request\nwill be made by the SDK.\n\nThe API method will document which error codes the service might return for\nthe operation. These errors will also be available as const strings prefixed\nwith \"ErrCode\" in the service client's package. If there are no errors listed\nin the API's SDK documentation you'll need to consult the AWS service's API\ndocumentation for the errors that could be returned.\n\nPagination helper methods are suffixed with \"Pages\", and provide the\nfunctionality needed to round trip API page requests. Pagination methods\ntake a callback function that will be called for each page of the API's response.\n\nWaiter helper methods provide the functionality to wait for an AWS resource\nstate. These methods abstract the logic needed to to check the state of an\nAWS resource, and wait until that resource is in a desired state. The waiter\nwill block until the resource is in the state that is desired, an error occurs,\nor the waiter times out. If a resource times out the error code returned will\nbe request.WaiterResourceNotReadyErrorCode.\n\nThis example shows a complete working Go file which will upload a file to S3\nand use the Context pattern to implement timeout logic that will cancel the\nrequest if it takes too long. This example highlights how to use sessions,\ncreate a service client, make a request, handle the error, and process the\nresponse.\n\nDeprecated: aws-sdk-go is deprecated.

The service also enables the client to fetch the user\u2019s access token\nupon successful authentication and authorization with IAM Identity Center.\n\nIAM Identity Center uses the sso and identitystore API namespaces. IAM Identity\nCenter OpenID Connect uses the sso-oauth namespace.\n\nBefore you begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the\nfollowing important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service\nworks.\n\nThe IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the portions\nof the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant standard (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628 ) that are necessary to\nenable single sign-on authentication with the CLI.\n\nWith older versions of the CLI, the service only emits OIDC access tokens,\nso to obtain a new token, users must explicitly re-authenticate. To access the\nOIDC flow that supports token refresh and doesn\u2019t require re-authentication,\nupdate to the latest CLI version (1.27.10 for CLI V1 and 2.9.0 for CLI V2) with\nsupport for OIDC token refresh and configurable IAM Identity Center session\ndurations. For more information, see Configure Amazon Web Services access portal session duration.\n\nThe access tokens provided by this service grant access to all Amazon Web\nServices account entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user, not just\na particular application.\n\nThe documentation in this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert\nthe access token into Amazon Web Services Auth (\u201csigv4\u201d) credentials for use\nwith IAM-protected Amazon Web Services service endpoints. For more information,\nsee GetRoleCredentialsin the IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference Guide.\n\nFor general information about IAM Identity Center, see What is IAM Identity Center? in the IAM Identity\nCenter User Guide.",

As\noutlined, these aliases are provided as a step to transition away from\na specific implementation which, as a result, exposes the full logrus API.\nWhile no decisions have been made on the ultimate design and interface\nprovided by this package, we do not expect carrying \"less common\" features.",

            "description": "Package platforms provides a toolkit for normalizing, matching and\nspecifying container platforms.\n\nCentered around OCI platform specifications, we define a string-based\nspecifier syntax that can be used for user input. With a specifier, users\nonly need to specify the parts of the platform that are relevant to their\ncontext, providing an operating system or architecture or both.\n\nHow do I use this package?\n\nThe vast majority of use cases should simply use the match function with\nuser input. The first step is to parse a specifier into a matcher:\n\nOnce you have a matcher, use it to match against the platform declared by a\ncomponent, typically from an image or runtime. Since extracting an images\nplatform is a little more involved, we'll use an example against the\nplatform default:\n\nThis can be composed in loops for resolving runtimes or used as a filter for\nfetch and select images.\n\nMore details of the specifier syntax and platform spec follow.\n\nComponents that have strict platform requirements should use the OCI\nplatform specification to declare their support. Typically, this will be\nimages and runtimes that should make these declaring which platform they\nsupport specifically. This looks roughly as follows:\n\nMost images and runtimes should at least set Architecture and OS, according\nto their GOARCH and GOOS values, respectively (follow the OCI image\nspecification when in doubt). ARM should set variant under certain\ndiscussions, which are outlined below.\n\nWhile the OCI platform specifications provide a tool for components to\nspecify structured information, user input typically doesn't need the full\ncontext and much can be inferred. To solve this problem, we introduced\n\"specifiers\". A specifier has the format\n`<os>|<arch>|<os>/<arch>[/<variant>]`.  The user can provide either the\noperating system or the architecture or both.\n\nAn example of a common specifier is `linux/amd64`. If the host has a default\nof runtime that matches this, the user can simply provide the component that\nmatters. For example, if a image provides amd64 and arm64 support, the\noperating system, `linux` can be inferred, so they only have to provide\n`arm64` or `amd64`. Similar behavior is implemented for operating systems,\nwhere the architecture may be known but a runtime may support images from\ndifferent operating systems.\n\nBecause not all users are familiar with the way the Go runtime represents\nplatforms, several normalizations have been provided to make this package\neasier to user.\n\nThe following are performed for architectures:\n\nWe also normalize the operating system `macos` to `darwin`.\n\nTo qualify ARM architecture, the Variant field is used to qualify the arm\nversion. The most common arm version, v7, is represented without the variant\nunless it is explicitly provided. This is treated as equivalent to armhf. A\nprevious architecture, armel, will be normalized to arm/v6.\n\nSimilarly, the most common arm64 version v8, and most common amd64 version v1\nare represented without the variant.\n\nWhile these normalizations are provided, their support on arm platforms has\nnot yet been fully implemented and tested.",

See\nhttps://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf for details on the standard.\n\nIn addition, sub packages are provided to produce, verify, parse, and serialize\nECDSA signatures and EC-Schnorr-DCRv0 (a custom Schnorr-based signature scheme\nspecific to Decred) signatures.  See the README.md files in the relevant sub\npackages for more details about those aspects.\n\nAn overview of the features provided by this package are as follows:\n\nIt also provides an implementation of the Go standard library crypto/elliptic\nCurve interface via the S256 function so that it may be used with other packages\nin the standard library such as crypto/tls, crypto/x509, and crypto/ecdsa.\nHowever, in the case of ECDSA, it is highly recommended to use the ecdsa sub\npackage of this package instead since it is optimized specifically for secp256k1\nand is significantly faster as a result.\n\nAlthough this package was primarily written for dcrd, it has intentionally been\ndesigned so it can be used as a standalone package for any projects needing to\nuse optimized secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography.\n\nFinally, a comprehensive suite of tests is provided to provide a high level of\nquality assurance.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the primary public key cryptography in widespread\nuse on the Decred network used to secure coins is based on elliptic curves\ndefined by the secp256k1 domain parameters.\n\nThis example demonstrates use of GenerateSharedSecret to encrypt a message\nfor a recipient's public key, and subsequently decrypt the message using the\nrecipient's private key.",

            "description": "Package restful , a lean package for creating REST-style WebServices without magic.\n\n### WebServices and Routes\n\nA WebService has a collection of Route objects that dispatch incoming Http Requests to a function calls.\nTypically, a WebService has a root path (e.g. /users) and defines common MIME types for its routes.\nWebServices must be added to a container (see below) in order to handler Http requests from a server.\n\nA Route is defined by a HTTP method, an URL path and (optionally) the MIME types it consumes (Content-Type) and produces (Accept).\nThis package has the logic to find the best matching Route and if found, call its Function.\n\nThe (*Request, *Response) arguments provide functions for reading information from the request and writing information back to the response.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/user-resource/restful-user-resource.go with a full implementation.\n\n### Regular expression matching Routes\n\nA Route parameter can be specified using the format \"uri/{var[:regexp]}\" or the special version \"uri/{var:*}\" for matching the tail of the path.\nFor example, /persons/{name:[A-Z][A-Z]} can be used to restrict values for the parameter \"name\" to only contain capital alphabetic characters.\nRegular expressions must use the standard Go syntax as described in the regexp package. (https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\n### Containers\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\n### Filters\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\n### Container Filters\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\n### WebService Filters\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\n### Route Filters\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\n### Response Encoding\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\n### OPTIONS support\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\n### CORS\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUnexpected things happen. If a request cannot be processed because of a failure, your service needs to tell via the response what happened and why.\nFor this reason HTTP status codes exist and it is important to use the correct code in every exceptional situation.\n\nIf path or query parameters are not valid (content or type) then use http.StatusBadRequest.\n\nDespite a valid URI, the resource requested may not be available\n\nIf the application logic could not process the request (or write the response) then use http.StatusInternalServerError.\n\nThe request has a valid URL but the method (GET,PUT,POST,...) is not allowed.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Accept Header set for this operation.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Content-Type Header set for this operation.\n\n### ServiceError\n\nIn addition to setting the correct (error) Http status code, you can choose to write a ServiceError message on the response.\n\n### Performance options\n\nThis package has several options that affect the performance of your service. It is important to understand them and how you can change it.\n\nDoNotRecover controls whether panics will be caught to return HTTP 500.\nIf set to false, the container will recover from panics.\nDefault value is true\n\nIf content encoding is enabled then the default strategy for getting new gzip/zlib writers and readers is to use a sync.Pool.\nBecause writers are expensive structures, performance is even more improved when using a preloaded cache. You can also inject your own implementation.\n\n### Trouble shooting\n\nThis package has the means to produce detail logging of the complete Http request matching process and filter invocation.\nEnabling this feature requires you to set an implementation of restful.StdLogger (e.g. log.Logger) instance such as:\n\n### Logging\n\nThe restful.SetLogger() method allows you to override the logger used by the package. By default restful\nuses the standard library `log` package and logs to stdout. Different logging packages are supported as\nlong as they conform to `StdLogger` interface defined in the `log` sub-package, writing an adapter for your\npreferred package is simple.\n\n### Resources\n\n(c) 2012-2025, http://ernestmicklei.com.

            "description": "Package mapstructure exposes functionality to convert one arbitrary\nGo type into another, typically to convert a map[string]any\ninto a native Go structure.\n\nThe Go structure can be arbitrarily complex, containing slices,\nother structs, etc. and the decoder will properly decode nested\nmaps and so on into the proper structures in the native Go struct.\nSee the examples to see what the decoder is capable of.\n\nThe simplest function to start with is Decode.\n\nWhen decoding to a struct, mapstructure will use the field name by\ndefault to perform the mapping. For example, if a struct has a field\n\"Username\" then mapstructure will look for a key in the source value\nof \"username\" (case insensitive).\n\nYou can change the behavior of mapstructure by using struct tags.\nThe default struct tag that mapstructure looks for is \"mapstructure\"\nbut you can customize it using DecoderConfig.\n\nTo rename the key that mapstructure looks for, use the \"mapstructure\"\ntag and set a value directly. For example, to change the \"username\" example\nabove to \"user\":\n\nEmbedded structs are treated as if they're another field with that name.\nBy default, the two structs below are equivalent when decoding with\nmapstructure:\n\nThis would require an input that looks like below:\n\nIf your \"person\" value is NOT nested, then you can append \",squash\" to\nyour tag value and mapstructure will treat it as if the embedded struct\nwere part of the struct directly. Example:\n\nNow the following input would be accepted:\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to a map, the squash tag squashes the struct\nfields into a single map. Using the example structs from above:\n\nWill be decoded into a map:\n\nDecoderConfig has a field that changes the behavior of mapstructure\nto always squash embedded structs.\n\nIf there are any unmapped keys in the source value, mapstructure by\ndefault will silently ignore them. You can error by setting ErrorUnused\nin DecoderConfig. If you're using Metadata you can also maintain a slice\nof the unused keys.\n\nYou can also use the \",remain\" suffix on your tag to collect all unused\nvalues in a map. The field with this tag MUST be a map type and should\nprobably be a \"map[string]any\" or \"map[any]any\".\nSee example below:\n\nGiven the input below, Other would be populated with the other\nvalues that weren't used (everything but \"name\"):\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitempty\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to\nthe zero value, or a zero-length element. The zero value of all types is\nspecified in the Go specification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type. And likewise for the URLs field, if the\nslice is nil or empty, it won't be encoded into the destination type.\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitzero\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to the zero\nvalue. The zero value of all types is specified in the Go specification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type. And likewise for the URLs field, if the\nslice is nil, it won't be encoded into the destination type.\n\nNote that if the field is a slice, and it is empty but not nil, it will\nstill be encoded into the destination type.\n\nSince unexported (private) struct fields cannot be set outside the package\nwhere they are defined, the decoder will simply skip them.\n\nFor this output type definition:\n\nUsing this map as input:\n\nThe following struct will be decoded:\n\nTypes can implement the Unmarshaler interface to control their own decoding. The interface\nbehaves similarly to how UnmarshalJSON does in the standard library. It can be used as an\nalternative or companion to a DecodeHook.\n\nSee the Unmarshaler interface documentation for more details.\n\nmapstructure is highly configurable. See the DecoderConfig struct\nfor other features and options that are supported.",

For basic numeric values or raw structs, this can cause\nefficiency differences when compared to equivalent C++ template code that\nstores values in arrays within the node:\n\nThese issues don't tend to matter, though, when working with strings or other\nheap-allocated structures, since C++-equivalent structures also must store\npointers and also distribute their values across the heap.\n\nThis implementation is designed to be a drop-in replacement to gollrb.LLRB\ntrees, (http://github.com/petar/gollrb), an excellent and probably the most\nwidely used ordered tree implementation in the Go ecosystem currently.\nIts functions, therefore, exactly mirror those of\nllrb.LLRB where possible.  Unlike gollrb, though, we currently don't\nsupport storing multiple equivalent values.\n\nThere are two implementations; those suffixed with 'G' are generics, usable\nfor any type, and require a passed-in \"less\" function to define their ordering.\nThose without this prefix are specific to the 'Item' interface, and use\nits 'Less' function for ordering.",

            "description": "Package websocket implements the WebSocket protocol defined in RFC 6455.\n\nThe Conn type represents a WebSocket connection. A server application calls\nthe Upgrader.Upgrade method from an HTTP request handler to get a *Conn:\n\nCall the connection's WriteMessage and ReadMessage methods to send and\nreceive messages as a slice of bytes. This snippet of code shows how to echo\nmessages using these methods:\n\nIn above snippet of code, p is a []byte and messageType is an int with value\nwebsocket.BinaryMessage or websocket.TextMessage.\n\nAn application can also send and receive messages using the io.WriteCloser\nand io.Reader interfaces. To send a message, call the connection NextWriter\nmethod to get an io.WriteCloser, write the message to the writer and close\nthe writer when done. To receive a message, call the connection NextReader\nmethod to get an io.Reader and read until io.EOF is returned. This snippet\nshows how to echo messages using the NextWriter and NextReader methods:\n\nThe WebSocket protocol distinguishes between text and binary data messages.\nText messages are interpreted as UTF-8 encoded text. The interpretation of\nbinary messages is left to the application.\n\nThis package uses the TextMessage and BinaryMessage integer constants to\nidentify the two data message types. The ReadMessage and NextReader methods\nreturn the type of the received message. The messageType argument to the\nWriteMessage and NextWriter methods specifies the type of a sent message.\n\nIt is the application's responsibility to ensure that text messages are\nvalid UTF-8 encoded text.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol defines three types of control messages: close, ping\nand pong. Call the connection WriteControl, WriteMessage or NextWriter\nmethods to send a control message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received close messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetCloseHandler method and by returning a *CloseError from the\nNextReader, ReadMessage or the message Read method. The default close\nhandler sends a close message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received ping messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPingHandler method. The default ping handler sends a pong\nmessage to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received pong messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPongHandler method. The default pong handler does nothing.\nIf an application sends ping messages, then the application should set a\npong handler to receive the corresponding pong.\n\nThe control message handler functions are called from the NextReader,\nReadMessage and message reader Read methods. The default close and ping\nhandlers can block these methods for a short time when the handler writes to\nthe connection.\n\nThe application must read the connection to process close, ping and pong\nmessages sent from the peer. If the application is not otherwise interested\nin messages from the peer, then the application should start a goroutine to\nread and discard messages from the peer. A simple example is:\n\nConnections support one concurrent reader and one concurrent writer.\n\nApplications are responsible for ensuring that no more than one goroutine\ncalls the write methods (NextWriter, SetWriteDeadline, WriteMessage,\nWriteJSON, EnableWriteCompression, SetCompressionLevel) concurrently and\nthat no more than one goroutine calls the read methods (NextReader,\nSetReadDeadline, ReadMessage, ReadJSON, SetPongHandler, SetPingHandler)\nconcurrently.\n\nThe Close and WriteControl methods can be called concurrently with all other\nmethods.\n\nWeb browsers allow Javascript applications to open a WebSocket connection to\nany host. It's up to the server to enforce an origin policy using the Origin\nrequest header sent by the browser.\n\nThe Upgrader calls the function specified in the CheckOrigin field to check\nthe origin. If the CheckOrigin function returns false, then the Upgrade\nmethod fails the WebSocket handshake with HTTP status 403.\n\nIf the CheckOrigin field is nil, then the Upgrader uses a safe default: fail\nthe handshake if the Origin request header is present and the Origin host is\nnot equal to the Host request header.\n\nThe deprecated package-level Upgrade function does not perform origin\nchecking. The application is responsible for checking the Origin header\nbefore calling the Upgrade function.\n\nConnections buffer network input and output to reduce the number\nof system calls when reading or writing messages.\n\nWrite buffers are also used for constructing WebSocket frames. See RFC 6455,\nSection 5 for a discussion of message framing. A WebSocket frame header is\nwritten to the network each time a write buffer is flushed to the network.\nDecreasing the size of the write buffer can increase the amount of framing\noverhead on the connection.\n\nThe buffer sizes in bytes are specified by the ReadBufferSize and\nWriteBufferSize fields in the Dialer and Upgrader. The Dialer uses a default\nsize of 4096 when a buffer size field is set to zero. The Upgrader reuses\nbuffers created by the HTTP server when a buffer size field is set to zero.\nThe HTTP server buffers have a size of 4096 at the time of this writing.\n\nThe buffer sizes do not limit the size of a message that can be read or\nwritten by a connection.\n\nBuffers are held for the lifetime of the connection by default. If the\nDialer or Upgrader WriteBufferPool field is set, then a connection holds the\nwrite buffer only when writing a message.\n\nApplications should tune the buffer sizes to balance memory use and\nperformance. Increasing the buffer size uses more memory, but can reduce the\nnumber of system calls to read or write the network. In the case of writing,\nincreasing the buffer size can reduce the number of frame headers written to\nthe network.\n\nSome guidelines for setting buffer parameters are:\n\nLimit the buffer sizes to the maximum expected message size. Buffers larger\nthan the largest message do not provide any benefit.\n\nDepending on the distribution of message sizes, setting the buffer size to\na value less than the maximum expected message size can greatly reduce memory\nuse with a small impact on performance. Here's an example: If 99% of the\nmessages are smaller than 256 bytes and the maximum message size is 512\nbytes, then a buffer size of 256 bytes will result in 1.01 more system calls\nthan a buffer size of 512 bytes. The memory savings is 50%.\n\nA write buffer pool is useful when the application has a modest number\nwrites over a large number of connections. when buffers are pooled, a larger\nbuffer size has a reduced impact on total memory use and has the benefit of\nreducing system calls and frame overhead.\n\nPer message compression extensions (RFC 7692) are experimentally supported\nby this package in a limited capacity. Setting the EnableCompression option\nto true in Dialer or Upgrader will attempt to negotiate per message deflate\nsupport.\n\nIf compression was successfully negotiated with the connection's peer, any\nmessage received in compressed form will be automatically decompressed.\nAll Read methods will return uncompressed bytes.\n\nPer message compression of messages written to a connection can be enabled\nor disabled by calling the corresponding Conn method:\n\nCurrently this package does not support compression with \"context takeover\".\nThis means that messages must be compressed and decompressed in isolation,\nwithout retaining sliding window or dictionary state across messages. For\nmore details refer to RFC 7692.\n\nUse of compression is experimental and may result in decreased performance.",

It is a thin wrapper over the\nstandard net/http client library and exposes nearly the same public API.\nThis makes retryablehttp very easy to drop into existing programs.\n\nretryablehttp performs automatic retries under certain conditions. Mainly, if\nan error is returned by the client (connection errors etc), or if a 500-range\nresponse is received, then a retry is invoked. Otherwise, the response is\nreturned and left to the caller to interpret.\n\nRequests which take a request body should provide a non-nil function\nparameter. The best choice is to provide either a function satisfying\nReaderFunc which provides multiple io.Readers in an efficient manner, a\n*bytes.Buffer (the underlying raw byte slice will be used) or a raw byte\nslice. As it is a reference type, and we will wrap it as needed by readers,\nwe can efficiently re-use the request body without needing to copy it. If an\nio.Reader (such as a *bytes.Reader) is provided, the full body will be read\nprior to the first request, and will be efficiently re-used for any retries.\nReadSeeker can be used, but some users have observed occasional data races\nbetween the net/http library and the Seek functionality of some\nimplementations of ReadSeeker, so should be avoided if possible.",

It tracks recent evictions as well\nas recent usage in both the frequent and recent caches. Its computational\noverhead is comparable to TwoQueueCache, but the memory overhead is linear\nwith the size of the cache.\n\nARC has been patented by IBM, so do not use it if that is problematic for\nyour program.

            "description": "Package pq is a Go PostgreSQL driver for database/sql.\n\nMost clients will use the database/sql package instead of using this package\ndirectly. For example:\n\nYou can also connect with an URL:\n\nSee NewConfig.\n\ndatabase/sql does not dictate any specific format for parameter placeholders,\nand pq uses the PostgreSQL-native ordinal markers ($1, $2, etc.). The same\nplaceholder can be used more than once:\n\npq does not support sql.Result.LastInsertId. Use the RETURNING clause with a\nQuery or QueryRow call instead to return the identifier:\n\nParameters pass through driver.DefaultParameterConverter before they are handled\nby this package. When the binary_parameters connection option is enabled, []byte\nvalues are sent directly to the backend as data in binary format.\n\nThis package returns the following types for values from the PostgreSQL backend:\n\nAll other types are returned directly from the backend as []byte values in text format.\n\npq may return errors of type *pq.Error which contain error details:\n\nYou can perform bulk imports by preparing a statement returned by CopyIn (or\nCopyInSchema) in an explicit transaction (sql.Tx). The returned statement\nhandle can then be repeatedly \"executed\" to copy data into the target table.\nAfter all data has been processed you should call Exec() once with no arguments\nto flush all buffered data. Any call to Exec() might return an error which\nshould be handled appropriately, but because of the internal buffering an error\nreturned by Exec() might not be related to the data passed in the call that\nfailed.\n\nCopyIn uses COPY FROM internally. It is not possible to COPY outside of an\nexplicit transaction in pq.\n\nPostgreSQL supports a simple publish/subscribe model using PostgreSQL's NOTIFY mechanism.\n\nTo start listening for notifications, you first have to open a new connection to\nthe database by calling NewListener. This connection can not be used for\nanything other than LISTEN / NOTIFY. Calling Listen will open a \"notification\nchannel\"; once a notification channel is open, a notification generated on that\nchannel will effect a send on the Listener.Notify channel. A notification\nchannel will remain open until Unlisten is called, though connection loss might\nresult in some notifications being lost. To solve this problem, Listener sends a\nnil pointer over the Notify channel any time the connection is re-established\nfollowing a connection loss. The application can get information about the state\nof the underlying connection by setting an event callback in the call to\nNewListener.\n\nA single Listener can safely be used from concurrent goroutines, which means\nthat there is often no need to create more than one Listener in your\napplication. However, a Listener is always connected to a single database, so\nyou will need to create a new Listener instance for every database you want to\nreceive notifications in.\n\nThe channel name in both Listen and Unlisten is case sensitive, and can contain\nany characters legal in an identifier. Note that the channel name will be\ntruncated to 63 bytes by the PostgreSQL server.\n\nYou can find a complete, working example of Listener usage at cmd/pqlisten.\n\nIf you need support for Kerberos authentication, add the following to your main\npackage:\n\nThis package is in a separate module so that users who don't need Kerberos don't\nhave to add unnecessary dependencies.",

For historical reasons, there is also some support for FreeBSD and OpenBSD,\nand a shallow implementation for Windows, but in general this is Linux-only package, so\nthe rest of the document only applies to Linux, unless explicitly specified otherwise.\n\nIn Linux, information about mounts seen by the current process is available from\n/proc/self/mountinfo. Note that due to mount namespaces, different processes can\nsee different mounts. A per-process mountinfo table is available from /proc/<PID>/mountinfo,\nwhere <PID> is a numerical process identifier.\n\nIn general, /proc is not a very efficient interface, and mountinfo is not an exception.\nFor example, there is no way to get information about a specific mount point (i.e. it\nis all-or-nothing). This package tries to hide the /proc ineffectiveness by using\nparse filters while reading mountinfo. A filter can skip some entries, or stop\nprocessing the rest of the file once the needed information is found.\n\nFor mountinfo filters that accept path as an argument, the path must be absolute,\nhaving all symlinks resolved, and being cleaned (i.e. no extra slashes or dots).\nOne way to achieve all of the above is to employ filepath.Abs followed by\nfilepath.EvalSymlinks (the latter calls filepath.Clean on the result so\nthere is no need to explicitly call filepath.Clean).\n\nNOTE that in many cases there is no need to consult mountinfo at all. Here are some\nof the cases where mountinfo should not be parsed:\n\n1. Before performing a mount. Usually, this is not needed, but if required (say to\nprevent over-mounts), to check whether a directory is mounted, call os.Lstat\non it and its parent directory, and compare their st.Sys().(*syscall.Stat_t).Dev\nfields -- if they differ, then the directory is the mount point. NOTE this does\nnot work for bind mounts. Optionally, the filesystem type can also be checked\nby calling unix.Statfs and checking the Type field (i.e. filesystem type).\n\n2. After performing a mount. If there is no error returned, the mount succeeded;\nchecking the mount table for a new mount is redundant and expensive.\n\n3. Before performing an unmount. It is more efficient to do an unmount and ignore\na specific error (EINVAL) which tells the directory is not mounted.\n\n4. After performing an unmount. If there is no error returned, the unmount succeeded.\n\n5. To find the mount point root of a specific directory. You can perform os.Stat()\non the directory and traverse up until the Dev field of a parent directory differs.",

The Digest type is\ndesigned to serve as a flexible identifier in a content-addressable system.\nMore importantly, it provides tools and wrappers to work with\nhash.Hash-based digests with little effort.\n\nThe format of a digest is simply a string with two parts, dubbed the\n\"algorithm\" and the \"digest\", separated by a colon:\n\nAn example of a sha256 digest representation follows:\n\nThe \"algorithm\" portion defines both the hashing algorithm used to calculate\nthe digest and the encoding of the resulting digest, which defaults to \"hex\"\nif not otherwise specified. Currently, all supported algorithms have their\ndigests encoded in hex strings.\n\nIn the example above, the string \"sha256\" is the algorithm and the hex bytes\nare the \"digest\".\n\nBecause the Digest type is simply a string, once a valid Digest is\nobtained, comparisons are cheap, quick and simple to express with the\nstandard equality operator.\n\nThe main benefit of using the Digest type is simple verification against a\ngiven digest. The Verifier interface, modeled after the stdlib hash.Hash\ninterface, provides a common write sink for digest verification. After\nwriting is complete, calling the Verifier.Verified method will indicate\nwhether or not the stream of bytes matches the target digest.\n\nIn addition to the above, we intend to add the following features to this\npackage:\n\n1. A Digester type that supports write sink digest calculation.\n\n2. Suspend and resume of ongoing digest calculations to support efficient digest verification in the registry.",

            "description": "Package digest provides a generalized type to opaquely represent message\ndigests and their operations within the registry. The Digest type is\ndesigned to serve as a flexible identifier in a content-addressable system.\nMore importantly, it provides tools and wrappers to work with\nhash.Hash-based digests with little effort.\n\nThe format of a digest is simply a string with two parts, dubbed the\n\"algorithm\" and the \"digest\", separated by a colon:\n\nAn example of a sha256 digest representation follows:\n\nThe \"algorithm\" portion defines both the hashing algorithm used to calculate\nthe digest and the encoding of the resulting digest, which defaults to \"hex\"\nif not otherwise specified. Currently, all supported algorithms have their\ndigests encoded in hex strings.\n\nIn the example above, the string \"sha256\" is the algorithm and the hex bytes\nare the \"digest\".\n\nBecause the Digest type is simply a string, once a valid Digest is\nobtained, comparisons are cheap, quick and simple to express with the\nstandard equality operator.\n\nThe main benefit of using the Digest type is simple verification against a\ngiven digest. The Verifier interface, modeled after the stdlib hash.Hash\ninterface, provides a common write sink for digest verification. After\nwriting is complete, calling the Verifier.Verified method will indicate\nwhether or not the stream of bytes matches the target digest.\n\nIn addition to the above, we intend to add the following features to this\npackage:\n\n1. A Digester type that supports write sink digest calculation.\n\n2. Suspend and resume of ongoing digest calculations to support efficient digest verification in the registry.",

For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace. Frame supports\nthe fmt.Formatter interface that can be used for printing information about\nthe stack trace of this error. For example:\n\nAlthough the stackTracer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nSee the documentation for Frame.Format for more details.",

            "description": "Package uniseg implements Unicode Text Segmentation, Unicode Line Breaking, and\nstring width calculation for monospace fonts. Unicode Text Segmentation conforms\nto Unicode Standard Annex #29 (https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/) and Unicode\nLine Breaking conforms to Unicode Standard Annex #14\n(https://unicode.org/reports/tr14/).\n\nIn short, using this package, you can split a string into grapheme clusters\n(what people would usually refer to as a \"character\"), into words, and into\nsentences. Or, in its simplest case, this package allows you to count the number\nof characters in a string, especially when it contains complex characters such\nas emojis, combining characters, or characters from Asian, Arabic, Hebrew, or\nother languages. Additionally, you can use it to implement line breaking (or\n\"word wrapping\"), that is, to determine where text can be broken over to the\nnext line when the width of the line is not big enough to fit the entire text.\nFinally, you can use it to calculate the display width of a string for monospace\nfonts.\n\nIf you just want to count the number of characters in a string, you can use\nGraphemeClusterCount. If you want to determine the display width of a string,\nyou can use StringWidth. If you want to iterate over a string, you can use\nStep, StepString, or the Graphemes class (more convenient but less\nperformant). This will provide you with all information: grapheme clusters,\nword boundaries, sentence boundaries, line breaks, and monospace character\nwidths. The specialized functions FirstGraphemeCluster,\nFirstGraphemeClusterInString, FirstWord, FirstWordInString,\nFirstSentence, and FirstSentenceInString can be used if only one type of\ninformation is needed.\n\nConsider the rainbow flag emoji: \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08. On most modern systems, it appears as one\ncharacter. But its string representation actually has 14 bytes, so counting\nbytes (or using len(\"\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\")) will not work as expected. Counting runes won't,\neither: The flag has 4 Unicode code points, thus 4 runes. The stdlib function\nutf8.RuneCountInString(\"\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\") and len([]rune(\"\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\")) will both return 4.\n\nThe GraphemeClusterCount function will return 1 for the rainbow flag emoji.\nThe Graphemes class and a variety of functions in this package will allow you to\nsplit strings into its grapheme clusters.\n\nWord boundaries are used in a number of different contexts. The most familiar\nones are selection (double-click mouse selection), cursor movement (\"move to\nnext word\" control-arrow keys), and the dialog option \"Whole Word Search\" for\nsearch and replace. This package provides methods for determining word\nboundaries.\n\nSentence boundaries are often used for triple-click or some other method of\nselecting or iterating through blocks of text that are larger than single words.\nThey are also used to determine whether words occur within the same sentence in\ndatabase queries. This package provides methods for determining sentence\nboundaries.\n\nLine breaking, also known as word wrapping, is the process of breaking a section\nof text into lines such that it will fit in the available width of a page,\nwindow or other display area. This package provides methods to determine the\npositions in a string where a line must be broken, may be broken, or must not be\nbroken.\n\nMonospace width, as referred to in this package, is the width of a string in a\nmonospace font. This is commonly used in terminal user interfaces or text\ndisplays or editors that don't support proportional fonts. A width of 1\ncorresponds to a single character cell. The C function wcswidth() and its\nimplementation in other programming languages is in widespread use for the same\npurpose. However, there is no standard for the calculation of such widths, and\nthis package differs from wcswidth() in a number of ways, presumably to generate\nmore visually pleasing results.\n\nTo start, we assume that every code point has a width of 1, with the following\nexceptions:\n\nFor Hangul grapheme clusters composed of conjoining Jamo and for Regional\nIndicators (flags), all code points except the first one have a width of 0. For\ngrapheme clusters starting with an Extended Pictographic, any additional code\npoint will force a total width of 2, except if the Variation Selector-15\n(U+FE0E) is included, in which case the total width is always 1. Grapheme\nclusters ending with Variation Selector-16 (U+FE0F) have a width of 2.\n\nNote that whether these widths appear correct depends on your application's\nrender engine, to which extent it conforms to the Unicode Standard, and its\nchoice of font.",

            "description": "SQL Schema migration tool for Go.\n\nKey features:\n\nTo install the library and command line program, use the following:\n\nThe main command is called sql-migrate.\n\nEach command requires a configuration file (which defaults to dbconfig.yml, but can be specified with the -config flag). This config file should specify one or more environments:\n\nThe `table` setting is optional and will default to `gorp_migrations`.\n\nThe environment that will be used can be specified with the -env flag (defaults to development).\n\nUse the --help flag in combination with any of the commands to get an overview of its usage:\n\nThe up command applies all available migrations. By contrast, down will only apply one migration by default. This behavior can be changed for both by using the -limit parameter.\n\nThe redo command will unapply the last migration and reapply it. This is useful during development, when you're writing migrations.\n\nUse the status command to see the state of the applied migrations:\n\nIf you are using MySQL, you must append ?parseTime=true to the datasource configuration. For example:\n\nSee https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#parsetime for more information.\n\nImport sql-migrate into your application:\n\nSet up a source of migrations, this can be from memory, from a set of files or from bindata (more on that later):\n\nThen use the Exec function to upgrade your database:\n\nNote that n can be greater than 0 even if there is an error: any migration that succeeded will remain applied even if a later one fails.\n\nThe full set of capabilities can be found in the API docs below.\n\nMigrations are defined in SQL files, which contain a set of SQL statements. Special comments are used to distinguish up and down migrations.\n\nYou can put multiple statements in each block, as long as you end them with a semicolon (;).\n\nIf you have complex statements which contain semicolons, use StatementBegin and StatementEnd to indicate boundaries:\n\nThe order in which migrations are applied is defined through the filename: sql-migrate will sort migrations based on their name. It's recommended to use an increasing version number or a timestamp as the first part of the filename.\n\nNormally each migration is run within a transaction in order to guarantee that it is fully atomic. However some SQL commands (for example creating an index concurrently in PostgreSQL) cannot be executed inside a transaction. In order to execute such a command in a migration, the migration can be run using the notransaction option:\n\nIf you like your Go applications self-contained (that is: a single binary): use packr (https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr) to embed the migration files.\n\nJust write your migration files as usual, as a set of SQL files in a folder.\n\nUse the PackrMigrationSource in your application to find the migrations:\n\nIf you already have a box and would like to use a subdirectory:\n\nAs an alternative, but slightly less maintained, you can use bindata (https://github.com/shuLhan/go-bindata) to embed the migration files.\n\nJust write your migration files as usual, as a set of SQL files in a folder.\n\nThen use bindata to generate a .go file with the migrations embedded:\n\nThe resulting bindata.go file will contain your migrations. Remember to regenerate your bindata.go file whenever you add/modify a migration (go generate will help here, once it arrives).\n\nUse the AssetMigrationSource in your application to find the migrations:\n\nBoth Asset and AssetDir are functions provided by bindata.\n\nThen proceed as usual.\n\nAdding a new migration source means implementing MigrationSource.\n\nThe resulting slice of migrations will be executed in the given order, so it should usually be sorted by the Id field.",

            "description": "Package blackfriday is a markdown processor.\n\nIt translates plain text with simple formatting rules into an AST, which can\nthen be further processed to HTML (provided by Blackfriday itself) or other\nformats (provided by the community).\n\nThe simplest way to invoke Blackfriday is to call the Run function. It will\ntake a text input and produce a text output in HTML (or other format).\n\nA slightly more sophisticated way to use Blackfriday is to create a Markdown\nprocessor and to call Parse, which returns a syntax tree for the input\ndocument. You can leverage Blackfriday's parsing for content extraction from\nmarkdown documents. You can assign a custom renderer and set various options\nto the Markdown processor.\n\nIf you're interested in calling Blackfriday from command line, see\nhttps://github.com/russross/blackfriday-tool.\n\nBlackfriday includes an algorithm for creating sanitized anchor names\ncorresponding to a given input text. This algorithm is used to create\nanchors for headings when AutoHeadingIDs extension is enabled. The\nalgorithm is specified below, so that other packages can create\ncompatible anchor names and links to those anchors.\n\nThe algorithm iterates over the input text, interpreted as UTF-8,\none Unicode code point (rune) at a time. All runes that are letters (category L)\nor numbers (category N) are considered valid characters. They are mapped to\nlower case, and included in the output. All other runes are considered\ninvalid characters. Invalid characters that precede the first valid character,\nas well as invalid character that follow the last valid character\nare dropped completely. All other sequences of invalid characters\nbetween two valid characters are replaced with a single dash character '-'.\n\nSanitizedAnchorName exposes this functionality, and can be used to\ncreate compatible links to the anchor names generated by blackfriday.\nThis algorithm is also implemented in a small standalone package at\ngithub.com/shurcooL/sanitized_anchor_name. It can be useful for clients\nthat want a small package and don't need full functionality of blackfriday.",

Put a backslash (\"\\\") in front of\nthe first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.\n\nAn optional prefix \"!\" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded\nby a previous pattern will become included again. If a negated pattern matches,\nthis will override lower precedence patterns sources. Put a backslash (\"\\\") in\nfront of the first \"!\" for patterns that begin with a literal \"!\", for example,\n\"\\!important!.txt\".\n\nIf the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the following\ndescription, but it would only find a match with a directory. In other words,\nfoo/ will match a directory foo and paths underneath it, but will not match a\nregular file or a symbolic link foo (this is consistent with the way how pathspec\nworks in general in Git).\n\nIf the pattern does not contain a slash /, Git treats it as a shell glob pattern\nand checks for a match against the pathname relative to the location of the\n.gitignore file (relative to the toplevel of the work tree if not from a\n.gitignore file).\n\nOtherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption by\nfnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the pattern will not match\na / in the pathname. For example, \"Documentation/*.html\" matches\n\"Documentation/git.html\" but not \"Documentation/ppc/ppc.html\" or/\n\"tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html\".\n\nA leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname. For example, \"/*.c\"\nmatches \"cat-file.c\" but not \"mozilla-sha1/sha1.c\".\n\nTwo consecutive asterisks (\"**\") in patterns matched against full pathname\nmay have special meaning:\n\nA leading \"**\" followed by a slash means match in all directories. For example,\n\"**/foo\" matches file or directory \"foo\" anywhere, the same as pattern \"foo\".\n\"**/foo/bar\" matches file or directory \"bar\" anywhere that is directly under\ndirectory \"foo\".\n\nA trailing \"/\" matches everything inside. For example, \"abc/\" matches all files\ninside directory \"abc\", relative to the location of the .gitignore file, with\ninfinite depth.\n\nA slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more\ndirectories. For example, \"a/**/b\" matches \"a/b\", \"a/x/b\", \"a/x/y/b\" and so on.\n\nOther consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.",

See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html\n\nUsage:\n\npflag is a drop-in replacement of Go's native flag package. If you import\npflag under the name \"flag\" then all code should continue to function\nwith no changes.\n\nThere is one exception to this: if you directly instantiate the Flag struct\nthere is one more field \"Shorthand\" that you will need to set.\nMost code never instantiates this struct directly, and instead uses\nfunctions such as String(), BoolVar(), and Var(), and is therefore\nunaffected.\n\nDefine flags using flag.String(), Bool(), Int(), etc.\n\nThis declares an integer flag, -flagname, stored in the pointer ip, with type *int.\n\nIf you like, you can bind the flag to a variable using the Var() functions.\n\nOr you can create custom flags that satisfy the Value interface (with\npointer receivers) and couple them to flag parsing by\n\nFor such flags, the default value is just the initial value of the variable.\n\nAfter all flags are defined, call\n\nto parse the command line into the defined flags.\n\nFlags may then be used directly. If you're using the flags themselves,\nthey are all pointers; if you bind to variables, they're values.\n\nAfter parsing, the arguments after the flag are available as the\nslice flag.Args() or individually as flag.Arg(i).\nThe arguments are indexed from 0 through flag.NArg()-1.\n\nThe pflag package also defines some new functions that are not in flag,\nthat give one-letter shorthands for flags. You can use these by appending\n'P' to the name of any function that defines a flag.\n\nShorthand letters can be used with single dashes on the command line.\nBoolean shorthand flags can be combined with other shorthand flags.\n\nCommand line flag syntax:\n\nUnlike the flag package, a single dash before an option means something\ndifferent than a double dash. Single dashes signify a series of shorthand\nletters for flags. All but the last shorthand letter must be boolean flags.\n\nFlag parsing stops after the terminator \"--\". Unlike the flag package,\nflags can be interspersed with arguments anywhere on the command line\nbefore this terminator.\n\nInteger flags accept 1234, 0664, 0x1234 and may be negative.\nBoolean flags (in their long form) accept 1, 0, t, f, true, false,\nTRUE, FALSE, True, False.\nDuration flags accept any input valid for time.ParseDuration.\n\nThe default set of command-line flags is controlled by\ntop-level functions.  The FlagSet type allows one to define\nindependent sets of flags, such as to implement subcommands\nin a command-line interface. The methods of FlagSet are\nanalogous to the top-level functions for the command-line\nflag set.",

If you import\npflag under the name \"flag\" then all code should continue to function\nwith no changes.\n\nThere is one exception to this: if you directly instantiate the Flag struct\nthere is one more field \"Shorthand\" that you will need to set.\nMost code never instantiates this struct directly, and instead uses\nfunctions such as String(), BoolVar(), and Var(), and is therefore\nunaffected.\n\nDefine flags using flag.String(), Bool(), Int(), etc.\n\nThis declares an integer flag, -flagname, stored in the pointer ip, with type *int.\n\nIf you like, you can bind the flag to a variable using the Var() functions.\n\nOr you can create custom flags that satisfy the Value interface (with\npointer receivers) and couple them to flag parsing by\n\nFor such flags, the default value is just the initial value of the variable.\n\nAfter all flags are defined, call\n\nto parse the command line into the defined flags.\n\nFlags may then be used directly. If you're using the flags themselves,\nthey are all pointers; if you bind to variables, they're values.\n\nAfter parsing, the arguments after the flag are available as the\nslice flag.Args() or individually as flag.Arg(i).\nThe arguments are indexed from 0 through flag.NArg()-1.\n\nThe pflag package also defines some new functions that are not in flag,\nthat give one-letter shorthands for flags. You can use these by appending\n'P' to the name of any function that defines a flag.\n\nShorthand letters can be used with single dashes on the command line.\nBoolean shorthand flags can be combined with other shorthand flags.\n\nCommand line flag syntax:\n\nUnlike the flag package, a single dash before an option means something\ndifferent than a double dash. Single dashes signify a series of shorthand\nletters for flags. All but the last shorthand letter must be boolean flags.\n\nFlag parsing stops after the terminator \"--\". Unlike the flag package,\nflags can be interspersed with arguments anywhere on the command line\nbefore this terminator.\n\nInteger flags accept 1234, 0664, 0x1234 and may be negative.\nBoolean flags (in their long form) accept 1, 0, t, f, true, false,\nTRUE, FALSE, True, False.\nDuration flags accept any input valid for time.ParseDuration.\n\nThe default set of command-line flags is controlled by\ntop-level functions.  The FlagSet type allows one to define\nindependent sets of flags, such as to implement subcommands\nin a command-line interface. The methods of FlagSet are\nanalogous to the top-level functions for the command-line\nflag set.",

It supports\nfully serializable transactions, ACID semantics, and lock-free MVCC with\nmultiple readers and a single writer. Bolt can be used for projects that\nwant a simple data store without the need to add large dependencies such as\nPostgres or MySQL.\n\nBolt is a single-level, zero-copy, B+tree data store. This means that Bolt is\noptimized for fast read access and does not require recovery in the event of a\nsystem crash. Transactions which have not finished committing will simply be\nrolled back in the event of a crash.\n\nThe design of Bolt is based on Howard Chu's LMDB database project.\n\nBolt currently works on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\n\nThere are only a few types in Bolt: DB, Bucket, Tx, and Cursor. The DB is\na collection of buckets and is represented by a single file on disk. A bucket is\na collection of unique keys that are associated with values.\n\nTransactions provide either read-only or read-write access to the database.\nRead-only transactions can retrieve key/value pairs and can use Cursors to\niterate over the dataset sequentially. Read-write transactions can create and\ndelete buckets and can insert and remove keys. Only one read-write transaction\nis allowed at a time.\n\nThe database uses a read-only, memory-mapped data file to ensure that\napplications cannot corrupt the database, however, this means that keys and\nvalues returned from Bolt cannot be changed. Writing to a read-only byte slice\nwill cause Go to panic.\n\nKeys and values retrieved from the database are only valid for the life of\nthe transaction. When used outside the transaction, these byte slices can\npoint to different data or can point to invalid memory which will cause a panic.",

            "description": "Package metric provides the OpenTelemetry API used to measure metrics about\nsource code operation.\n\nThis API is separate from its implementation so the instrumentation built from\nit is reusable. See go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric for the official\nOpenTelemetry implementation of this API.\n\nAll measurements made with this package are made via instruments. These\ninstruments are created by a Meter which itself is created by a\nMeterProvider. Applications need to accept a MeterProvider implementation\nas a starting point when instrumenting. This can be done directly, or by using\nthe OpenTelemetry global MeterProvider via GetMeterProvider. Using an\nappropriately named Meter from the accepted MeterProvider, instrumentation\ncan then be built from the Meter's instruments.\n\nEach instrument is designed to make measurements of a particular type. Broadly,\nall instruments fall into two overlapping logical categories: asynchronous or\nsynchronous, and int64 or float64.\n\nAll synchronous instruments (Int64Counter, Int64UpDownCounter,\nInt64Histogram, Float64Counter, Float64UpDownCounter, and\nFloat64Histogram) are used to measure the operation and performance of source\ncode during the source code execution. These instruments only make measurements\nwhen the source code they instrument is run.\n\nAll asynchronous instruments (Int64ObservableCounter,\nInt64ObservableUpDownCounter, Int64ObservableGauge,\nFloat64ObservableCounter, Float64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) are used to measure metrics outside of the execution\nof source code. They are said to make \"observations\" via a callback function\ncalled once every measurement collection cycle.\n\nEach instrument is also grouped by the value type it measures. Either int64 or\nfloat64. The value being measured will dictate which instrument in these\ncategories to use.\n\nOutside of these two broad categories, instruments are described by the\nfunction they are designed to serve. All Counters (Int64Counter,\nFloat64Counter, Int64ObservableCounter, and Float64ObservableCounter) are\ndesigned to measure values that never decrease in value, but instead only\nincrementally increase in value. UpDownCounters (Int64UpDownCounter,\nFloat64UpDownCounter, Int64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableUpDownCounter) on the other hand, are designed to measure\nvalues that can increase and decrease. When more information needs to be\nconveyed about all the synchronous measurements made during a collection cycle,\na Histogram (Int64Histogram and Float64Histogram) should be used. Finally,\nwhen just the most recent measurement needs to be conveyed about an\nasynchronous measurement, a Gauge (Int64ObservableGauge and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) should be used.\n\nSee the OpenTelemetry documentation for more information about instruments\nand their intended use.\n\nOpenTelemetry defines an instrument name syntax that restricts what\ninstrument names are allowed.\n\nInstrument names should ...\n\nTo ensure compatibility with observability platforms, all instruments created\nneed to conform to this syntax.

            "description": "Package zap provides fast, structured, leveled logging.\n\nFor applications that log in the hot path, reflection-based serialization\nand string formatting are prohibitively expensive - they're CPU-intensive\nand make many small allocations. Put differently, using json.Marshal and\nfmt.Fprintf to log tons of interface{} makes your application slow.\n\nZap takes a different approach. It includes a reflection-free,\nzero-allocation JSON encoder, and the base Logger strives to avoid\nserialization overhead and allocations wherever possible. By building the\nhigh-level SugaredLogger on that foundation, zap lets users choose when\nthey need to count every allocation and when they'd prefer a more familiar,\nloosely typed API.\n\nIn contexts where performance is nice, but not critical, use the\nSugaredLogger. It's 4-10x faster than other structured logging packages and\nsupports both structured and printf-style logging. Like log15 and go-kit,\nthe SugaredLogger's structured logging APIs are loosely typed and accept a\nvariadic number of key-value pairs.

This allows developers to\nextend Kubernetes with their own APIs that behave like core Kubernetes APIs, complete\nwith typed clients, authentication, authorization, and discovery.\n\nThe `apiserver` library is composed of several key packages:\n\nThe `GenericAPIServer` struct is the heart of any extension server. It is responsible\nfor assembling and running the HTTP serving stack. See the runnable example for a\ndemonstration of how to instantiate a `GenericAPIServer`.\n\nThe mechanism that enables extension API servers is API aggregation. The\nprimary apiserver (typically the kube-apiserver) acts as a proxy, forwarding\nrequests for a specific API group (e.g., /apis/myextension.io/v1) to a\nregistered extension server. The apiserver is configured using\nAPIService objects.\n\nFor most use cases, custom resources (CustomResourceDefinitions) are the\npreferred way to extend the Kubernetes API.\n\nThe `pkg/admission` package provides a way to add admission policies directly\ninto an apiserver. Admission plugins can be used to validate or mutate objects\nduring write operations. The kube-apiserver uses admission plugins to provide\na variety of core system capabilities.\n\nFor most extension use cases dynamic admission control using policies\n(ValidatingAdmissionPolicies or MutatingAdmissionPolicies) or\nwebhooks (ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and MutatingWebhookConfiguration) are the\npreferred way to extend admission control.",

            "description": "Package clientgo is the official Go client for the Kubernetes API. It provides\na standard set of clients and tools for building applications, controllers,\nand operators that communicate with a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nkubernetes: Contains the typed Clientset for interacting with built-in,\nversioned API objects (e.g., Pods, Deployments). This is the most common\nstarting point.\n\ndynamic: Provides a dynamic client that can perform operations on any\nKubernetes object, including Custom Resources (CRs). It is essential for\nbuilding controllers that work with CRDs.\n\ndiscovery: Used to discover the API groups, versions, and resources\nsupported by a Kubernetes cluster.\n\ntools/cache: The foundation of the controller pattern. This package provides\nefficient caching and synchronization mechanisms (Informers and Listers)\nfor building controllers.\n\ntools/clientcmd: Provides methods for loading client configuration from\nkubeconfig files. This is essential for out-of-cluster applications and CLI tools.\n\nrest: Provides a lower-level RESTClient that manages the details of\ncommunicating with the Kubernetes API server. It is useful for advanced\nuse cases that require fine-grained control over requests, such as working\nwith non-standard REST verbs.\n\nThere are two primary ways to configure a client to connect to the API server:\n\nIn-Cluster Configuration: For applications running inside a Kubernetes pod,\nthe `rest.InClusterConfig()` function provides a straightforward way to\nconfigure the client. It automatically uses the pod's service account for\nauthentication and is the recommended approach for controllers and operators.\n\nOut-of-Cluster Configuration: For local development or command-line tools,\nthe `clientcmd` package is used to load configuration from a\nkubeconfig file.\n\nThe `rest.Config` object allows for fine-grained control over client-side\nperformance and reliability. Key settings include:\n\nOnce configured, a client can be used to interact with objects in the cluster.\n\nThe Typed Clientset (`kubernetes` package) provides a strongly typed\ninterface for working with built-in Kubernetes objects.\n\nThe Dynamic Client (`dynamic` package) can work with any object, including\nCustom Resources, using `unstructured.Unstructured` types.\n\nFor Custom Resources (CRDs), the `k8s.io/code-generator` repository\ncontains the tools to generate typed clients, informers, and listers. The\n`sample-controller` is the canonical example of this pattern.\n\nServer-Side Apply is a patching strategy that allows multiple actors to\nshare management of an object by tracking field ownership. This prevents\nactors from inadvertently overwriting each other's changes and provides\na mechanism for resolving conflicts. The `applyconfigurations` package\nprovides the necessary tools for this declarative approach.\n\nRobust error handling is essential when interacting with the API. The\n`k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/errors` package provides functions to inspect\nerrors and check for common conditions, such as whether a resource was not\nfound or already exists. This allows controllers to implement robust,\nidempotent reconciliation logic.\n\nThe controller pattern is central to Kubernetes. A controller observes the\nstate of the cluster and works to bring it to the desired state.\n\nThe `tools/cache` package provides the building blocks for this pattern.\nInformers watch the API server and maintain a local cache, Listers provide\nread-only access to the cache, and Workqueues decouple event detection\nfrom processing.\n\nIn a high-availability deployment where multiple instances of a controller\nare running, leader election (`tools/leaderelection`) is used to ensure\nthat only one instance is active at a time.\n\nClient-side feature gates allow for enabling or disabling experimental\nfeatures in `client-go`. They can be configured via the `rest.Config` object.",
