            "description": "Package capnp is a Cap'n Proto library for Go.\nhttps://capnproto.org/\n\nRead the Getting Started guide for a tutorial on how to use this\npackage. https://github.com/capnproto/go-capnproto2/wiki/Getting-Started\n\ncapnpc-go provides the compiler backend for capnp.\n\ncapnpc-go requires two annotations for all files: package and import.\npackage is needed to know what package to place at the head of the\ngenerated file and what identifier to use when referring to the type\nfrom another package.  import should be the fully qualified import path\nand is used to generate import statement from other packages and to\ndetect when two types are in the same package.  For example:\n\nFor adding documentation comments to the generated code, there's the doc\nannotation. This annotation adds the comment to a struct, enum or field so\nthat godoc will pick it up. For example:\n\nIn Cap'n Proto, the unit of communication is a message. A message\nconsists of one or more segments -- contiguous blocks of memory.  This\nallows large messages to be split up and loaded independently or lazily.\nTypically you will use one segment per message.  Logically, a message is\norganized in a tree of objects, with the root always being a struct (as\nopposed to a list or primitive).  Messages can be read from and written\nto a stream.\n\nThe Message and Segment types are the main types that application code\nwill use from this package.  The Message type has methods for marshaling\nand unmarshaling its segments to the wire format.  If the application\nneeds to read or write from a stream, it should use the Encoder and\nDecoder types.\n\nThe type for a generic reference to a Cap'n Proto object is Ptr.  A Ptr\ncan refer to a struct, a list, or an interface.  Ptr, Struct, List, and\nInterface (the pointer types) have value semantics and refer to data in\na single segment.  All of the pointer types have a notion of \"valid\".\nAn invalid pointer will return the default value from any accessor and\npanic when any setter is called.\n\nIn previous versions of this package, the Pointer interface was used\ninstead of the Ptr struct.  This interface and functions that use it are\nnow deprecated.  See https://github.com/capnproto/go-capnproto2/wiki/New-Ptr-Type\nfor details about this API change.\n\nData accessors and setters (i.e. struct primitive fields and list\nelements) do not return errors, but pointer accessors and setters do.\nThere are a few reasons that a read or write of a pointer can fail, but\nthe most common are bad pointers or allocation failures.  For accessors,\nan invalid object will be returned in case of an error.\n\nSince Go doesn't have generics, wrapper types provide type safety on\nlists.  This package provides lists of basic types, and capnpc-go\ngenerates list wrappers for named types.  However, if you need to use\ndeeper nesting of lists (e.g. List(List(UInt8))), you will need to use a\nPointerList and wrap the elements.\n\nFor the following schema:\n\ncapnpc-go will generate:\n\nFor each group a typedef is created with a different method set for just the\ngroups fields:\n\ngenerates the following:\n\nThat way the following may be used to access a field in a group:\n\nNote that group accessors just convert the type and so have no overhead.\n\nNamed unions are treated as a group with an inner unnamed union. Unnamed\nunions generate an enum Type_Which and a corresponding Which() function:\n\ngenerates the following:\n\nWhich() should be checked before using the getters, and the default case must\nalways be handled.\n\nSetters for single values will set the union discriminator as well as set the\nvalue.\n\nFor voids in unions, there is a void setter that just sets the discriminator.\nFor example:\n\ngenerates the following:\n\nSimilarly, for groups in unions, there is a group setter that just sets\nthe discriminator. This must be called before the group getter can be\nused to set values. For example:\n\nand in usage:\n\ncapnpc-go generates enum values as constants. For example in the capnp file:\n\nIn the generated capnp.go file:\n\nIn addition an enum.String() function is generated that will convert the constants to a string\nfor debugging or logging purposes. By default, the enum name is used as the tag value,\nbut the tags can be customized with a $Go.tag or $Go.notag annotation.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn the generated go file:\n\ncapnpc-go generates type-safe Client wrappers for interfaces. For parameter\nlists and result lists, structs are generated as described above with the names\nInterface_method_Params and Interface_method_Results, unless a single struct\ntype is used. For example, for this interface:\n\ncapnpc-go generates the following Go code (along with the structs\nCalculator_evaluate_Params and Calculator_evaluate_Results):\n\ncapnpc-go also generates code to implement the interface:\n\nSince a single capability may want to implement many interfaces, you can\nuse multiple *_Methods functions to build a single slice to send to\nNewServer.\n\nAn example of combining the client/server code to communicate with a locally\nimplemented Calculator:\n\nA note about message ordering: by default, only one method per server will\nbe invoked at a time; when implementing a server method which blocks or takes\na long time, you calling the server.Go function to unblock future calls.",

            "description": "A helper to merge structs and maps in Golang. Useful for configuration default values, avoiding messy if-statements.\n\nMergo merges same-type structs and maps by setting default values in zero-value fields. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields. It will do recursively any exported one. It also won't merge structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nIt is ready for production use. It is used in several projects by Docker, Google, The Linux Foundation, VMWare, Shopify, etc.\n\n1.0.0\n\nIn 1.0.0 Mergo moves to a vanity URL `dario.cat/mergo`.\n\n0.3.9\n\nPlease keep in mind that a problematic PR broke 0.3.9. We reverted it in 0.3.10. We consider 0.3.10 as stable but not bug-free. . Also, this version adds suppot for go modules.\n\nKeep in mind that in 0.3.2, Mergo changed Merge() and Map() signatures to support transformers. We added an optional/variadic argument so that it won't break the existing code.\n\nIf you were using Mergo before April 6th, 2015, please check your project works as intended after updating your local copy with go get -u dario.cat/mergo. I apologize for any issue caused by its previous behavior and any future bug that Mergo could cause in existing projects after the change (release 0.2.0).\n\nDo your usual installation procedure:\n\nYou can only merge same-type structs with exported fields initialized as zero value of their type and same-types maps. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields but will do recursively any exported one. It won't merge empty structs value as they are zero values too. Also, maps will be merged recursively except for structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nAlso, you can merge overwriting values using the transformer WithOverride.\n\nAdditionally, you can map a map[string]interface{} to a struct (and otherwise, from struct to map), following the same restrictions as in Merge(). Keys are capitalized to find each corresponding exported field.\n\nWarning: if you map a struct to map, it won't do it recursively. Don't expect Mergo to map struct members of your struct as map[string]interface{}. They will be just assigned as values.\n\nHere is a nice example:\n\nTransformers allow to merge specific types differently than in the default behavior. In other words, now you can customize how some types are merged. For example, time.Time is a struct; it doesn't have zero value but IsZero can return true because it has fields with zero value. How can we merge a non-zero time.Time?\n\nIf I can help you, you have an idea or you are using Mergo in your projects, don't hesitate to drop me a line (or a pull request): https://twitter.com/im_dario\n\nWritten by Dario Casta\u00f1\u00e9: https://da.rio.hn\n\nBSD 3-Clause license, as Go language.",

The `StrictNewVersion`\nfunction only parses valid version 2 semantic versions as outlined in the\nspecification. The `NewVersion` function attempts to coerce a version into a\nsemantic version and parse it. For example, if there is a leading v or a version\nlisted without all 3 parts (e.g. 1.2) it will attempt to coerce it into a valid\nsemantic version (e.g., 1.2.0). In both cases a `Version` object is returned\nthat can be sorted, compared, and used in constraints.\n\nWhen parsing a version an optional error can be returned if there is an issue\nparsing the version. For example,\n\nThe version object has methods to get the parts of the version, compare it to\nother versions, convert the version back into a string, and get the original\nstring. For more details please see the documentation\nat https://godoc.org/github.com/Masterminds/semver.\n\nA set of versions can be sorted using the `sort` package from the standard library.\nFor example,\n\nThere are two methods for comparing versions. One uses comparison methods on\n`Version` instances and the other is using Constraints.

The `StrictNewVersion`\nfunction only parses valid version 2 semantic versions as outlined in the\nspecification. The `NewVersion` function attempts to coerce a version into a\nsemantic version and parse it. For example, if there is a leading v or a version\nlisted without all 3 parts (e.g. 1.2) it will attempt to coerce it into a valid\nsemantic version (e.g., 1.2.0). In both cases a `Version` object is returned\nthat can be sorted, compared, and used in constraints.\n\nWhen parsing a version an optional error can be returned if there is an issue\nparsing the version. For example,\n\nThe version object has methods to get the parts of the version, compare it to\nother versions, convert the version back into a string, and get the original\nstring. For more details please see the documentation\nat https://godoc.org/github.com/Masterminds/semver.\n\nA set of versions can be sorted using the `sort` package from the standard library.\nFor example,\n\nThere are two methods for comparing versions.

            "description": "Package platforms provides a toolkit for normalizing, matching and\nspecifying container platforms.\n\nCentered around OCI platform specifications, we define a string-based\nspecifier syntax that can be used for user input. With a specifier, users\nonly need to specify the parts of the platform that are relevant to their\ncontext, providing an operating system or architecture or both.\n\nHow do I use this package?\n\nThe vast majority of use cases should simply use the match function with\nuser input. The first step is to parse a specifier into a matcher:\n\nOnce you have a matcher, use it to match against the platform declared by a\ncomponent, typically from an image or runtime. Since extracting an images\nplatform is a little more involved, we'll use an example against the\nplatform default:\n\nThis can be composed in loops for resolving runtimes or used as a filter for\nfetch and select images.\n\nMore details of the specifier syntax and platform spec follow.\n\nComponents that have strict platform requirements should use the OCI\nplatform specification to declare their support. Typically, this will be\nimages and runtimes that should make these declaring which platform they\nsupport specifically. This looks roughly as follows:\n\nMost images and runtimes should at least set Architecture and OS, according\nto their GOARCH and GOOS values, respectively (follow the OCI image\nspecification when in doubt). ARM should set variant under certain\ndiscussions, which are outlined below.\n\nWhile the OCI platform specifications provide a tool for components to\nspecify structured information, user input typically doesn't need the full\ncontext and much can be inferred. To solve this problem, we introduced\n\"specifiers\". A specifier has the format\n`<os>|<arch>|<os>/<arch>[/<variant>]`.  The user can provide either the\noperating system or the architecture or both.\n\nAn example of a common specifier is `linux/amd64`. If the host has a default\nof runtime that matches this, the user can simply provide the component that\nmatters. For example, if a image provides amd64 and arm64 support, the\noperating system, `linux` can be inferred, so they only have to provide\n`arm64` or `amd64`. Similar behavior is implemented for operating systems,\nwhere the architecture may be known but a runtime may support images from\ndifferent operating systems.\n\nBecause not all users are familiar with the way the Go runtime represents\nplatforms, several normalizations have been provided to make this package\neasier to user.\n\nThe following are performed for architectures:\n\nWe also normalize the operating system `macos` to `darwin`.\n\nTo qualify ARM architecture, the Variant field is used to qualify the arm\nversion. The most common arm version, v7, is represented without the variant\nunless it is explicitly provided. This is treated as equivalent to armhf. A\nprevious architecture, armel, will be normalized to arm/v6.\n\nSimilarly, the most common arm64 version v8, and most common amd64 version v1\nare represented without the variant.\n\nWhile these normalizations are provided, their support on arm platforms has\nnot yet been fully implemented and tested.",

            "description": "Package securejoin implements a set of helpers to make it easier to write Go\ncode that is safe against symlink-related escape attacks. The primary idea\nis to let you resolve a path within a rootfs directory as if the rootfs was\na chroot.\n\nsecurejoin has two APIs, a \"legacy\" API and a \"modern\" API.\n\nThe legacy API is SecureJoin and SecureJoinVFS. These methods are\n**not** safe against race conditions where an attacker changes the\nfilesystem after (or during) the SecureJoin operation.\n\nThe new API is available in the pathrs-lite subpackage, and provide\nprotections against racing attackers as well as several other key\nprotections against attacks often seen by container runtimes. As the name\nsuggests, pathrs-lite is a stripped down (pure Go) reimplementation of\nlibpathrs. The main APIs provided are OpenInRoot, MkdirAll, and\nprocfs.Handle -- other APIs are not planned to be ported. The long-term\ngoal is for users to migrate to libpathrs which is more fully-featured.\n\nsecurejoin has been used by several container runtimes (Docker, runc,\nKubernetes, etc) for quite a few years as a de-facto standard for operating\non container filesystem paths \"safely\". However, most users still use the\nlegacy API which is unsafe against various attacks (there is a fairly long\nhistory of CVEs in dependent as a result). Users should switch to the modern\nAPI as soon as possible (or even better, switch to libpathrs).\n\nThis project was initially intended to be included in the Go standard\nlibrary, but it was rejected (see https://go.dev/issue/20126). Much later,\nos.Root was added to the Go stdlib that shares some of the goals of\nfilepath-securejoin. However, its design is intended to work like\nopenat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH) which does not fit the usecase of container\nruntimes and most system tools.",

(https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\n### Containers\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\n### Filters\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\n### Container Filters\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\n### WebService Filters\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\n### Route Filters\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\n### Response Encoding\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\n### OPTIONS support\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\n### CORS\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUnexpected things happen. If a request cannot be processed because of a failure, your service needs to tell via the response what happened and why.\nFor this reason HTTP status codes exist and it is important to use the correct code in every exceptional situation.\n\nIf path or query parameters are not valid (content or type) then use http.StatusBadRequest.\n\nDespite a valid URI, the resource requested may not be available\n\nIf the application logic could not process the request (or write the response) then use http.StatusInternalServerError.\n\nThe request has a valid URL but the method (GET,PUT,POST,...) is not allowed.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Accept Header set for this operation.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Content-Type Header set for this operation.\n\n### ServiceError\n\nIn addition to setting the correct (error) Http status code, you can choose to write a ServiceError message on the response.\n\n### Performance options\n\nThis package has several options that affect the performance of your service. It is important to understand them and how you can change it.\n\nDoNotRecover controls whether panics will be caught to return HTTP 500.\nIf set to false, the container will recover from panics.\nDefault value is true\n\nIf content encoding is enabled then the default strategy for getting new gzip/zlib writers and readers is to use a sync.Pool.\nBecause writers are expensive structures, performance is even more improved when using a preloaded cache. You can also inject your own implementation.\n\n### Trouble shooting\n\nThis package has the means to produce detail logging of the complete Http request matching process and filter invocation.\nEnabling this feature requires you to set an implementation of restful.StdLogger (e.g. log.Logger) instance such as:\n\n### Logging\n\nThe restful.SetLogger() method allows you to override the logger used by the package. By default restful\nuses the standard library `log` package and logs to stdout. Different logging packages are supported as\nlong as they conform to `StdLogger` interface defined in the `log` sub-package, writing an adapter for your\npreferred package is simple.\n\n### Resources\n\n(c) 2012-2025, http://ernestmicklei.com.

            "description": "Package gcfg reads \"INI-style\" text-based configuration files with\n\"name=value\" pairs grouped into sections (gcfg files).\n\nThis package is still a work in progress; see the sections below for planned\nchanges.\n\nThe syntax is based on that used by git config:\nhttp://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_syntax .\nThere are some (planned) differences compared to the git config format:\n\nThe functions in this package read values into a user-defined struct.\nEach section corresponds to a struct field in the config struct, and each\nvariable in a section corresponds to a data field in the section struct.\nThe mapping of each section or variable name to fields is done either based\non the \"gcfg\" struct tag or by matching the name of the section or variable,\nignoring case. In the latter case, hyphens '-' in section and variable names\ncorrespond to underscores '_' in field names.\nFields must be exported; to use a section or variable name starting with a\nletter that is neither upper- or lower-case, prefix the field name with 'X'.\n(See https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=5763#c4 .)\n\nFor sections with subsections, the corresponding field in config must be a\nmap, rather than a struct, with string keys and pointer-to-struct values.\nValues for subsection variables are stored in the map with the subsection\nname used as the map key.\n(Note that unlike section and variable names, subsection names are case\nsensitive.)\nWhen using a map, and there is a section with the same section name but\nwithout a subsection name, its values are stored with the empty string used\nas the key.\nIt is possible to provide default values for subsections in the section\n\"default-<sectionname>\" (or by setting values in the corresponding struct\nfield \"Default_<sectionname>\").\n\nThe functions in this package panic if config is not a pointer to a struct,\nor when a field is not of a suitable type (either a struct or a map with\nstring keys and pointer-to-struct values).\n\nThe section structs in the config struct may contain single-valued or\nmulti-valued variables. Variables of unnamed slice type (that is, a type\nstarting with `[]`) are treated as multi-value; all others (including named\nslice types) are treated as single-valued variables.\n\nSingle-valued variables are handled based on the type as follows.\nUnnamed pointer types (that is, types starting with `*`) are dereferenced,\nand if necessary, a new instance is allocated.\n\nFor types implementing the encoding.TextUnmarshaler interface, the\nUnmarshalText method is used to set the value. Implementing this method is\nthe recommended way for parsing user-defined types.\n\nFor fields of string kind, the value string is assigned to the field, after\nunquoting and unescaping as needed.\nFor fields of bool kind, the field is set to true if the value is \"true\",\n\"yes\", \"on\" or \"1\", and set to false if the value is \"false\", \"no\", \"off\" or\n\"0\", ignoring case. In addition, single-valued bool fields can be specified\nwith a \"blank\" value (variable name without equals sign and value); in such\ncase the value is set to true.\n\nPredefined integer types [u]int(|8|16|32|64) and big.Int are parsed as\ndecimal or hexadecimal (if having '0x' prefix). (This is to prevent\nunintuitively handling zero-padded numbers as octal.) Other types having\n[u]int* as the underlying type, such as os.FileMode and uintptr allow\ndecimal, hexadecimal, or octal values.\nParsing mode for integer types can be overridden using the struct tag option\n\",int=mode\" where mode is a combination of the 'd', 'h', and 'o' characters\n(each standing for decimal, hexadecimal, and octal, respectively.)\n\nAll other types are parsed using fmt.Sscanf with the \"%v\" verb.\n\nFor multi-valued variables, each individual value is parsed as above and\nappended to the slice. If the first value is specified as a \"blank\" value\n(variable name without equals sign and value), a new slice is allocated;\nthat is any values previously set in the slice will be ignored.\n\nThe types subpackage for provides helpers for parsing \"enum-like\" and integer\ntypes.\n\nThere are 3 types of errors:\n\nProgrammer errors trigger panics. These are should be fixed by the programmer\nbefore releasing code that uses gcfg.\n\nData errors cause gcfg to return a non-nil error value. This includes the\ncase when there are extra unknown key-value definitions in the configuration\ndata (extra data).\nHowever, in some occasions it is desirable to be able to proceed in\nsituations when the only data error is that of extra data.\nThese errors are handled at a different (warning) priority and can be\nfiltered out programmatically. To ignore extra data warnings, wrap the\ngcfg.Read*Into invocation into a call to gcfg.FatalOnly.\n\nThe following is a list of changes under consideration:",

The acquired connection then can be used to call methods\non remote objects and emit or receive signals. Using the Export method, you can\narrange D-Bus methods calls to be directly translated to method calls on a Go\nvalue.\n\nFor outgoing messages, Go types are automatically converted to the\ncorresponding D-Bus types. See the official specification at\nhttps://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#type-system for more\ninformation on the D-Bus type system. The following types are directly encoded\nas their respective D-Bus equivalents:\n\nSlices and arrays encode as ARRAYs of their element type.\n\nMaps encode as DICTs, provided that their key type can be used as a key for\na DICT.\n\nStructs other than Variant and Signature encode as a STRUCT containing their\nexported fields in order. Fields whose tags contain `dbus:\"-\"` and unexported\nfields will be skipped.\n\nPointers encode as the value they're pointed to.\n\nTypes convertible to one of the base types above will be mapped as the\nbase type.\n\nTrying to encode any other type or a slice, map or struct containing an\nunsupported type will result in an InvalidTypeError.\n\nFor incoming messages, the inverse of these rules are used, with the exception\nof STRUCTs. Incoming STRUCTS are represented as a slice of empty interfaces\ncontaining the struct fields in the correct order. The Store function can be\nused to convert such values to Go structs.\n\nHandling Unix file descriptors deserves special mention. To use them, you should\nfirst check that they are supported on a connection by calling SupportsUnixFDs.\nIf it returns true, all method of Connection will translate messages containing\nUnixFD's to messages that are accompanied by the given file descriptors with the\nUnixFD values being substituted by the correct indices. Similarly, the indices\nof incoming messages are automatically resolved. It shouldn't be necessary to use\nUnixFDIndex.",

            "description": "Package mux implements a request router and dispatcher.\n\nThe name mux stands for \"HTTP request multiplexer\". Like the standard\nhttp.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of\nregistered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL\nor other conditions. The main features are:\n\nLet's start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:\n\nHere we register three routes mapping URL paths to handlers. This is\nequivalent to how http.HandleFunc() works: if an incoming request URL matches\none of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passing\n(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) as parameters.\n\nPaths can have variables. They are defined using the format {name} or\n{name:pattern}. If a regular expression pattern is not defined, the matched\nvariable will be anything until the next slash. For example:\n\nGroups can be used inside patterns, as long as they are non-capturing (?:re). For example:\n\nThe names are used to create a map of route variables which can be retrieved\ncalling mux.Vars():\n\nNote that if any capturing groups are present, mux will panic() during parsing. To prevent\nthis, convert any capturing groups to non-capturing, e.g. change \"/{sort:(asc|desc)}\" to\n\"/{sort:(?:asc|desc)}\". This is a change from prior versions which behaved unpredictably\nwhen capturing groups were present.\n\nAnd this is all you need to know about the basic usage. More advanced options\nare explained below.\n\nRoutes can also be restricted to a domain or subdomain. Just define a host\npattern to be matched. They can also have variables:\n\nThere are several other matchers that can be added. To match path prefixes:\n\n...or HTTP methods:\n\n...or URL schemes:\n\n...or header values:\n\n...or query values:\n\n...or to use a custom matcher function:\n\n...and finally, it is possible to combine several matchers in a single route:\n\nSetting the same matching conditions again and again can be boring, so we have\na way to group several routes that share the same requirements.\nWe call it \"subrouting\".\n\nFor example, let's say we have several URLs that should only match when the\nhost is \"www.example.com\". Create a route for that host and get a \"subrouter\"\nfrom it:\n\nThen register routes in the subrouter:\n\nThe three URL paths we registered above will only be tested if the domain is\n\"www.example.com\", because the subrouter is tested first. This is not\nonly convenient, but also optimizes request matching. You can create\nsubrouters combining any attribute matchers accepted by a route.\n\nSubrouters can be used to create domain or path \"namespaces\": you define\nsubrouters in a central place and then parts of the app can register its\npaths relatively to a given subrouter.\n\nThere's one more thing about subroutes. When a subrouter has a path prefix,\nthe inner routes use it as base for their paths:\n\nNote that the path provided to PathPrefix() represents a \"wildcard\": calling\nPathPrefix(\"/static/\").Handler(...) means that the handler will be passed any\nrequest that matches \"/static/*\". This makes it easy to serve static files with mux:\n\nNow let's see how to build registered URLs.\n\nRoutes can be named. All routes that define a name can have their URLs built,\nor \"reversed\". We define a name calling Name() on a route. For example:\n\nTo build a URL, get the route and call the URL() method, passing a sequence of\nkey/value pairs for the route variables. For the previous route, we would do:\n\n...and the result will be a url.URL with the following path:\n\nThis also works for host and query value variables:\n\nAll variables defined in the route are required, and their values must\nconform to the corresponding patterns. These requirements guarantee that a\ngenerated URL will always match a registered route -- the only exception is\nfor explicitly defined \"build-only\" routes which never match.\n\nRegex support also exists for matching Headers within a route. For example, we could do:\n\n...and the route will match both requests with a Content-Type of `application/json` as well as\n`application/text`\n\nThere's also a way to build only the URL host or path for a route:\nuse the methods URLHost() or URLPath() instead. For the previous route,\nwe would do:\n\nAnd if you use subrouters, host and path defined separately can be built\nas well:\n\nMux supports the addition of middlewares to a Router, which are executed in the order they are added if a match is found, including its subrouters. Middlewares are (typically) small pieces of code which take one request, do something with it, and pass it down to another middleware or the final handler. Some common use cases for middleware are request logging, header manipulation, or ResponseWriter hijacking.\n\nTypically, the returned handler is a closure which does something with the http.ResponseWriter and http.Request passed to it, and then calls the handler passed as parameter to the MiddlewareFunc (closures can access variables from the context where they are created).\n\nA very basic middleware which logs the URI of the request being handled could be written as:\n\nMiddlewares can be added to a router using `Router.Use()`:\n\nA more complex authentication middleware, which maps session token to users, could be written as:\n\nNote: The handler chain will be stopped if your middleware doesn't call `next.ServeHTTP()` with the corresponding parameters. This can be used to abort a request if the middleware writer wants to.",

            "description": "Package websocket implements the WebSocket protocol defined in RFC 6455.\n\nThe Conn type represents a WebSocket connection. A server application calls\nthe Upgrader.Upgrade method from an HTTP request handler to get a *Conn:\n\nCall the connection's WriteMessage and ReadMessage methods to send and\nreceive messages as a slice of bytes. This snippet of code shows how to echo\nmessages using these methods:\n\nIn above snippet of code, p is a []byte and messageType is an int with value\nwebsocket.BinaryMessage or websocket.TextMessage.\n\nAn application can also send and receive messages using the io.WriteCloser\nand io.Reader interfaces. To send a message, call the connection NextWriter\nmethod to get an io.WriteCloser, write the message to the writer and close\nthe writer when done. To receive a message, call the connection NextReader\nmethod to get an io.Reader and read until io.EOF is returned. This snippet\nshows how to echo messages using the NextWriter and NextReader methods:\n\nThe WebSocket protocol distinguishes between text and binary data messages.\nText messages are interpreted as UTF-8 encoded text. The interpretation of\nbinary messages is left to the application.\n\nThis package uses the TextMessage and BinaryMessage integer constants to\nidentify the two data message types. The ReadMessage and NextReader methods\nreturn the type of the received message. The messageType argument to the\nWriteMessage and NextWriter methods specifies the type of a sent message.\n\nIt is the application's responsibility to ensure that text messages are\nvalid UTF-8 encoded text.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol defines three types of control messages: close, ping\nand pong. Call the connection WriteControl, WriteMessage or NextWriter\nmethods to send a control message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received close messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetCloseHandler method and by returning a *CloseError from the\nNextReader, ReadMessage or the message Read method. The default close\nhandler sends a close message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received ping messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPingHandler method. The default ping handler sends a pong\nmessage to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received pong messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPongHandler method. The default pong handler does nothing.\nIf an application sends ping messages, then the application should set a\npong handler to receive the corresponding pong.\n\nThe control message handler functions are called from the NextReader,\nReadMessage and message reader Read methods. The default close and ping\nhandlers can block these methods for a short time when the handler writes to\nthe connection.\n\nThe application must read the connection to process close, ping and pong\nmessages sent from the peer. If the application is not otherwise interested\nin messages from the peer, then the application should start a goroutine to\nread and discard messages from the peer. A simple example is:\n\nConnections support one concurrent reader and one concurrent writer.\n\nApplications are responsible for ensuring that no more than one goroutine\ncalls the write methods (NextWriter, SetWriteDeadline, WriteMessage,\nWriteJSON, EnableWriteCompression, SetCompressionLevel) concurrently and\nthat no more than one goroutine calls the read methods (NextReader,\nSetReadDeadline, ReadMessage, ReadJSON, SetPongHandler, SetPingHandler)\nconcurrently.\n\nThe Close and WriteControl methods can be called concurrently with all other\nmethods.\n\nWeb browsers allow Javascript applications to open a WebSocket connection to\nany host. It's up to the server to enforce an origin policy using the Origin\nrequest header sent by the browser.\n\nThe Upgrader calls the function specified in the CheckOrigin field to check\nthe origin. If the CheckOrigin function returns false, then the Upgrade\nmethod fails the WebSocket handshake with HTTP status 403.\n\nIf the CheckOrigin field is nil, then the Upgrader uses a safe default: fail\nthe handshake if the Origin request header is present and the Origin host is\nnot equal to the Host request header.\n\nThe deprecated package-level Upgrade function does not perform origin\nchecking. The application is responsible for checking the Origin header\nbefore calling the Upgrade function.\n\nConnections buffer network input and output to reduce the number\nof system calls when reading or writing messages.\n\nWrite buffers are also used for constructing WebSocket frames. See RFC 6455,\nSection 5 for a discussion of message framing. A WebSocket frame header is\nwritten to the network each time a write buffer is flushed to the network.\nDecreasing the size of the write buffer can increase the amount of framing\noverhead on the connection.\n\nThe buffer sizes in bytes are specified by the ReadBufferSize and\nWriteBufferSize fields in the Dialer and Upgrader. The Dialer uses a default\nsize of 4096 when a buffer size field is set to zero. The Upgrader reuses\nbuffers created by the HTTP server when a buffer size field is set to zero.\nThe HTTP server buffers have a size of 4096 at the time of this writing.\n\nThe buffer sizes do not limit the size of a message that can be read or\nwritten by a connection.\n\nBuffers are held for the lifetime of the connection by default. If the\nDialer or Upgrader WriteBufferPool field is set, then a connection holds the\nwrite buffer only when writing a message.\n\nApplications should tune the buffer sizes to balance memory use and\nperformance. Increasing the buffer size uses more memory, but can reduce the\nnumber of system calls to read or write the network. In the case of writing,\nincreasing the buffer size can reduce the number of frame headers written to\nthe network.\n\nSome guidelines for setting buffer parameters are:\n\nLimit the buffer sizes to the maximum expected message size. Buffers larger\nthan the largest message do not provide any benefit.\n\nDepending on the distribution of message sizes, setting the buffer size to\na value less than the maximum expected message size can greatly reduce memory\nuse with a small impact on performance. Here's an example: If 99% of the\nmessages are smaller than 256 bytes and the maximum message size is 512\nbytes, then a buffer size of 256 bytes will result in 1.01 more system calls\nthan a buffer size of 512 bytes. The memory savings is 50%.\n\nA write buffer pool is useful when the application has a modest number\nwrites over a large number of connections. when buffers are pooled, a larger\nbuffer size has a reduced impact on total memory use and has the benefit of\nreducing system calls and frame overhead.\n\nPer message compression extensions (RFC 7692) are experimentally supported\nby this package in a limited capacity. Setting the EnableCompression option\nto true in Dialer or Upgrader will attempt to negotiate per message deflate\nsupport.\n\nIf compression was successfully negotiated with the connection's peer, any\nmessage received in compressed form will be automatically decompressed.\nAll Read methods will return uncompressed bytes.\n\nPer message compression of messages written to a connection can be enabled\nor disabled by calling the corresponding Conn method:\n\nCurrently this package does not support compression with \"context takeover\".\nThis means that messages must be compressed and decompressed in isolation,\nwithout retaining sliding window or dictionary state across messages. For\nmore details refer to RFC 7692.\n\nUse of compression is experimental and may result in decreased performance.",

For example, if a struct has a field\n\"Username\" then mapstructure will look for a key in the source value\nof \"username\" (case insensitive).\n\nYou can change the behavior of mapstructure by using struct tags.\nThe default struct tag that mapstructure looks for is \"mapstructure\"\nbut you can customize it using DecoderConfig.\n\nTo rename the key that mapstructure looks for, use the \"mapstructure\"\ntag and set a value directly. For example, to change the \"username\" example\nabove to \"user\":\n\nEmbedded structs are treated as if they're another field with that name.\nBy default, the two structs below are equivalent when decoding with\nmapstructure:\n\nThis would require an input that looks like below:\n\nIf your \"person\" value is NOT nested, then you can append \",squash\" to\nyour tag value and mapstructure will treat it as if the embedded struct\nwere part of the struct directly. Example:\n\nNow the following input would be accepted:\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to a map, the squash tag squashes the struct\nfields into a single map. Using the example structs from above:\n\nWill be decoded into a map:\n\nDecoderConfig has a field that changes the behavior of mapstructure\nto always squash embedded structs.\n\nIf there are any unmapped keys in the source value, mapstructure by\ndefault will silently ignore them. You can error by setting ErrorUnused\nin DecoderConfig. If you're using Metadata you can also maintain a slice\nof the unused keys.\n\nYou can also use the \",remain\" suffix on your tag to collect all unused\nvalues in a map. The field with this tag MUST be a map type and should\nprobably be a \"map[string]interface{}\" or \"map[interface{}]interface{}\".\nSee example below:\n\nGiven the input below, Other would be populated with the other\nvalues that weren't used (everything but \"name\"):\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitempty\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to\nthe zero value. The zero value of all types is specified in the Go\nspecification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type.\n\nSince unexported (private) struct fields cannot be set outside the package\nwhere they are defined, the decoder will simply skip them.\n\nFor this output type definition:\n\nUsing this map as input:\n\nThe following struct will be decoded:\n\nmapstructure is highly configurable. See the DecoderConfig struct\nfor other features and options that are supported.",

For historical reasons, there is also some support for FreeBSD and OpenBSD,\nand a shallow implementation for Windows, but in general this is Linux-only package, so\nthe rest of the document only applies to Linux, unless explicitly specified otherwise.\n\nIn Linux, information about mounts seen by the current process is available from\n/proc/self/mountinfo. Note that due to mount namespaces, different processes can\nsee different mounts. A per-process mountinfo table is available from /proc/<PID>/mountinfo,\nwhere <PID> is a numerical process identifier.\n\nIn general, /proc is not a very efficient interface, and mountinfo is not an exception.\nFor example, there is no way to get information about a specific mount point (i.e. it\nis all-or-nothing). This package tries to hide the /proc ineffectiveness by using\nparse filters while reading mountinfo. A filter can skip some entries, or stop\nprocessing the rest of the file once the needed information is found.\n\nFor mountinfo filters that accept path as an argument, the path must be absolute,\nhaving all symlinks resolved, and being cleaned (i.e. no extra slashes or dots).\nOne way to achieve all of the above is to employ filepath.Abs followed by\nfilepath.EvalSymlinks (the latter calls filepath.Clean on the result so\nthere is no need to explicitly call filepath.Clean).\n\nNOTE that in many cases there is no need to consult mountinfo at all. Here are some\nof the cases where mountinfo should not be parsed:\n\n1. Before performing a mount. Usually, this is not needed, but if required (say to\nprevent over-mounts), to check whether a directory is mounted, call os.Lstat\non it and its parent directory, and compare their st.Sys().(*syscall.Stat_t).Dev\nfields -- if they differ, then the directory is the mount point. NOTE this does\nnot work for bind mounts. Optionally, the filesystem type can also be checked\nby calling unix.Statfs and checking the Type field (i.e. filesystem type).\n\n2. After performing a mount. If there is no error returned, the mount succeeded;\nchecking the mount table for a new mount is redundant and expensive.\n\n3. Before performing an unmount. It is more efficient to do an unmount and ignore\na specific error (EINVAL) which tells the directory is not mounted.\n\n4. After performing an unmount. If there is no error returned, the unmount succeeded.\n\n5. To find the mount point root of a specific directory. You can perform os.Stat()\non the directory and traverse up until the Dev field of a parent directory differs.",

            "description": "Package mountinfo provides a set of functions to retrieve information about OS mounts.\n\nCurrently it supports Linux. For historical reasons, there is also some support for FreeBSD and OpenBSD,\nand a shallow implementation for Windows, but in general this is Linux-only package, so\nthe rest of the document only applies to Linux, unless explicitly specified otherwise.\n\nIn Linux, information about mounts seen by the current process is available from\n/proc/self/mountinfo. Note that due to mount namespaces, different processes can\nsee different mounts. A per-process mountinfo table is available from /proc/<PID>/mountinfo,\nwhere <PID> is a numerical process identifier.\n\nIn general, /proc is not a very efficient interface, and mountinfo is not an exception.\nFor example, there is no way to get information about a specific mount point (i.e. it\nis all-or-nothing). This package tries to hide the /proc ineffectiveness by using\nparse filters while reading mountinfo. A filter can skip some entries, or stop\nprocessing the rest of the file once the needed information is found.\n\nFor mountinfo filters that accept path as an argument, the path must be absolute,\nhaving all symlinks resolved, and being cleaned (i.e. no extra slashes or dots).\nOne way to achieve all of the above is to employ filepath.Abs followed by\nfilepath.EvalSymlinks (the latter calls filepath.Clean on the result so\nthere is no need to explicitly call filepath.Clean).\n\nNOTE that in many cases there is no need to consult mountinfo at all. Here are some\nof the cases where mountinfo should not be parsed:\n\n1. Before performing a mount. Usually, this is not needed, but if required (say to\nprevent over-mounts), to check whether a directory is mounted, call os.Lstat\non it and its parent directory, and compare their st.Sys().(*syscall.Stat_t).Dev\nfields -- if they differ, then the directory is the mount point. NOTE this does\nnot work for bind mounts. Optionally, the filesystem type can also be checked\nby calling unix.Statfs and checking the Type field (i.e. filesystem type).\n\n2. After performing a mount. If there is no error returned, the mount succeeded;\nchecking the mount table for a new mount is redundant and expensive.\n\n3. Before performing an unmount. It is more efficient to do an unmount and ignore\na specific error (EINVAL) which tells the directory is not mounted.\n\n4. After performing an unmount. If there is no error returned, the unmount succeeded.\n\n5. To find the mount point root of a specific directory. You can perform os.Stat()\non the directory and traverse up until the Dev field of a parent directory differs.",

            "description": "Package uniseg implements Unicode Text Segmentation, Unicode Line Breaking, and\nstring width calculation for monospace fonts. Unicode Text Segmentation conforms\nto Unicode Standard Annex #29 (https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/) and Unicode\nLine Breaking conforms to Unicode Standard Annex #14\n(https://unicode.org/reports/tr14/).\n\nIn short, using this package, you can split a string into grapheme clusters\n(what people would usually refer to as a \"character\"), into words, and into\nsentences. Or, in its simplest case, this package allows you to count the number\nof characters in a string, especially when it contains complex characters such\nas emojis, combining characters, or characters from Asian, Arabic, Hebrew, or\nother languages. Additionally, you can use it to implement line breaking (or\n\"word wrapping\"), that is, to determine where text can be broken over to the\nnext line when the width of the line is not big enough to fit the entire text.\nFinally, you can use it to calculate the display width of a string for monospace\nfonts.\n\nIf you just want to count the number of characters in a string, you can use\nGraphemeClusterCount. If you want to determine the display width of a string,\nyou can use StringWidth. If you want to iterate over a string, you can use\nStep, StepString, or the Graphemes class (more convenient but less\nperformant). This will provide you with all information: grapheme clusters,\nword boundaries, sentence boundaries, line breaks, and monospace character\nwidths. The specialized functions FirstGraphemeCluster,\nFirstGraphemeClusterInString, FirstWord, FirstWordInString,\nFirstSentence, and FirstSentenceInString can be used if only one type of\ninformation is needed.\n\nConsider the rainbow flag emoji: \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08. On most modern systems, it appears as one\ncharacter. But its string representation actually has 14 bytes, so counting\nbytes (or using len(\"\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\")) will not work as expected. Counting runes won't,\neither: The flag has 4 Unicode code points, thus 4 runes. The stdlib function\nutf8.RuneCountInString(\"\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\") and len([]rune(\"\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\")) will both return 4.\n\nThe GraphemeClusterCount function will return 1 for the rainbow flag emoji.\nThe Graphemes class and a variety of functions in this package will allow you to\nsplit strings into its grapheme clusters.\n\nWord boundaries are used in a number of different contexts. The most familiar\nones are selection (double-click mouse selection), cursor movement (\"move to\nnext word\" control-arrow keys), and the dialog option \"Whole Word Search\" for\nsearch and replace. This package provides methods for determining word\nboundaries.\n\nSentence boundaries are often used for triple-click or some other method of\nselecting or iterating through blocks of text that are larger than single words.\nThey are also used to determine whether words occur within the same sentence in\ndatabase queries. This package provides methods for determining sentence\nboundaries.\n\nLine breaking, also known as word wrapping, is the process of breaking a section\nof text into lines such that it will fit in the available width of a page,\nwindow or other display area. This package provides methods to determine the\npositions in a string where a line must be broken, may be broken, or must not be\nbroken.\n\nMonospace width, as referred to in this package, is the width of a string in a\nmonospace font. This is commonly used in terminal user interfaces or text\ndisplays or editors that don't support proportional fonts. A width of 1\ncorresponds to a single character cell. The C function wcswidth() and its\nimplementation in other programming languages is in widespread use for the same\npurpose. However, there is no standard for the calculation of such widths, and\nthis package differs from wcswidth() in a number of ways, presumably to generate\nmore visually pleasing results.\n\nTo start, we assume that every code point has a width of 1, with the following\nexceptions:\n\nFor Hangul grapheme clusters composed of conjoining Jamo and for Regional\nIndicators (flags), all code points except the first one have a width of 0. For\ngrapheme clusters starting with an Extended Pictographic, any additional code\npoint will force a total width of 2, except if the Variation Selector-15\n(U+FE0E) is included, in which case the total width is always 1. Grapheme\nclusters ending with Variation Selector-16 (U+FE0F) have a width of 2.\n\nNote that whether these widths appear correct depends on your application's\nrender engine, to which extent it conforms to the Unicode Standard, and its\nchoice of font.",

It will\ntake a text input and produce a text output in HTML (or other format).\n\nA slightly more sophisticated way to use Blackfriday is to create a Markdown\nprocessor and to call Parse, which returns a syntax tree for the input\ndocument. You can leverage Blackfriday's parsing for content extraction from\nmarkdown documents. You can assign a custom renderer and set various options\nto the Markdown processor.\n\nIf you're interested in calling Blackfriday from command line, see\nhttps://github.com/russross/blackfriday-tool.\n\nBlackfriday includes an algorithm for creating sanitized anchor names\ncorresponding to a given input text. This algorithm is used to create\nanchors for headings when AutoHeadingIDs extension is enabled. The\nalgorithm is specified below, so that other packages can create\ncompatible anchor names and links to those anchors.\n\nThe algorithm iterates over the input text, interpreted as UTF-8,\none Unicode code point (rune) at a time. All runes that are letters (category L)\nor numbers (category N) are considered valid characters. They are mapped to\nlower case, and included in the output. All other runes are considered\ninvalid characters. Invalid characters that precede the first valid character,\nas well as invalid character that follow the last valid character\nare dropped completely. All other sequences of invalid characters\nbetween two valid characters are replaced with a single dash character '-'.\n\nSanitizedAnchorName exposes this functionality, and can be used to\ncreate compatible links to the anchor names generated by blackfriday.\nThis algorithm is also implemented in a small standalone package at\ngithub.com/shurcooL/sanitized_anchor_name. It can be useful for clients\nthat want a small package and don't need full functionality of blackfriday.",

            "description": "Package pflag is a drop-in replacement for Go's flag package, implementing\nPOSIX/GNU-style --flags.\n\npflag is compatible with the GNU extensions to the POSIX recommendations\nfor command-line options. See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html\n\nUsage:\n\npflag is a drop-in replacement of Go's native flag package. If you import\npflag under the name \"flag\" then all code should continue to function\nwith no changes.\n\nThere is one exception to this: if you directly instantiate the Flag struct\nthere is one more field \"Shorthand\" that you will need to set.\nMost code never instantiates this struct directly, and instead uses\nfunctions such as String(), BoolVar(), and Var(), and is therefore\nunaffected.\n\nDefine flags using flag.String(), Bool(), Int(), etc.\n\nThis declares an integer flag, -flagname, stored in the pointer ip, with type *int.\n\nIf you like, you can bind the flag to a variable using the Var() functions.\n\nOr you can create custom flags that satisfy the Value interface (with\npointer receivers) and couple them to flag parsing by\n\nFor such flags, the default value is just the initial value of the variable.\n\nAfter all flags are defined, call\n\nto parse the command line into the defined flags.\n\nFlags may then be used directly. If you're using the flags themselves,\nthey are all pointers; if you bind to variables, they're values.\n\nAfter parsing, the arguments after the flag are available as the\nslice flag.Args() or individually as flag.Arg(i).\nThe arguments are indexed from 0 through flag.NArg()-1.\n\nThe pflag package also defines some new functions that are not in flag,\nthat give one-letter shorthands for flags. You can use these by appending\n'P' to the name of any function that defines a flag.\n\nShorthand letters can be used with single dashes on the command line.\nBoolean shorthand flags can be combined with other shorthand flags.\n\nCommand line flag syntax:\n\nUnlike the flag package, a single dash before an option means something\ndifferent than a double dash. Single dashes signify a series of shorthand\nletters for flags. All but the last shorthand letter must be boolean flags.\n\nFlag parsing stops after the terminator \"--\". Unlike the flag package,\nflags can be interspersed with arguments anywhere on the command line\nbefore this terminator.\n\nInteger flags accept 1234, 0664, 0x1234 and may be negative.\nBoolean flags (in their long form) accept 1, 0, t, f, true, false,\nTRUE, FALSE, True, False.\nDuration flags accept any input valid for time.ParseDuration.\n\nThe default set of command-line flags is controlled by\ntop-level functions.  The FlagSet type allows one to define\nindependent sets of flags, such as to implement subcommands\nin a command-line interface. The methods of FlagSet are\nanalogous to the top-level functions for the command-line\nflag set.",

            "description": "Package metric provides the OpenTelemetry API used to measure metrics about\nsource code operation.\n\nThis API is separate from its implementation so the instrumentation built from\nit is reusable. See go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric for the official\nOpenTelemetry implementation of this API.\n\nAll measurements made with this package are made via instruments. These\ninstruments are created by a Meter which itself is created by a\nMeterProvider. Applications need to accept a MeterProvider implementation\nas a starting point when instrumenting. This can be done directly, or by using\nthe OpenTelemetry global MeterProvider via GetMeterProvider. Using an\nappropriately named Meter from the accepted MeterProvider, instrumentation\ncan then be built from the Meter's instruments.\n\nEach instrument is designed to make measurements of a particular type. Broadly,\nall instruments fall into two overlapping logical categories: asynchronous or\nsynchronous, and int64 or float64.\n\nAll synchronous instruments (Int64Counter, Int64UpDownCounter,\nInt64Histogram, Float64Counter, Float64UpDownCounter, and\nFloat64Histogram) are used to measure the operation and performance of source\ncode during the source code execution. These instruments only make measurements\nwhen the source code they instrument is run.\n\nAll asynchronous instruments (Int64ObservableCounter,\nInt64ObservableUpDownCounter, Int64ObservableGauge,\nFloat64ObservableCounter, Float64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) are used to measure metrics outside of the execution\nof source code. They are said to make \"observations\" via a callback function\ncalled once every measurement collection cycle.\n\nEach instrument is also grouped by the value type it measures. Either int64 or\nfloat64. The value being measured will dictate which instrument in these\ncategories to use.\n\nOutside of these two broad categories, instruments are described by the\nfunction they are designed to serve. All Counters (Int64Counter,\nFloat64Counter, Int64ObservableCounter, and Float64ObservableCounter) are\ndesigned to measure values that never decrease in value, but instead only\nincrementally increase in value. UpDownCounters (Int64UpDownCounter,\nFloat64UpDownCounter, Int64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableUpDownCounter) on the other hand, are designed to measure\nvalues that can increase and decrease. When more information needs to be\nconveyed about all the synchronous measurements made during a collection cycle,\na Histogram (Int64Histogram and Float64Histogram) should be used. Finally,\nwhen just the most recent measurement needs to be conveyed about an\nasynchronous measurement, a Gauge (Int64ObservableGauge and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) should be used.\n\nSee the OpenTelemetry documentation for more information about instruments\nand their intended use.\n\nOpenTelemetry defines an instrument name syntax that restricts what\ninstrument names are allowed.\n\nInstrument names should ...\n\nTo ensure compatibility with observability platforms, all instruments created\nneed to conform to this syntax. Not all implementations of the API will validate\nthese names, it is the callers responsibility to ensure compliance.\n\nMeasurements are made by recording values and information about the values with\nan instrument. How these measurements are recorded depends on the instrument.\n\nMeasurements for synchronous instruments (Int64Counter, Int64UpDownCounter,\nInt64Histogram, Float64Counter, Float64UpDownCounter, and\nFloat64Histogram) are recorded using the instrument methods directly. All\ncounter instruments have an Add method that is used to measure an increment\nvalue, and all histogram instruments have a Record method to measure a data\npoint.\n\nAsynchronous instruments (Int64ObservableCounter,\nInt64ObservableUpDownCounter, Int64ObservableGauge,\nFloat64ObservableCounter, Float64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) record measurements within a callback function. The\ncallback is registered with the Meter which ensures the callback is called once\nper collection cycle. A callback can be registered two ways: during the\ninstrument's creation using an option, or later using the RegisterCallback\nmethod of the Meter that created the instrument.\n\nIf the following criteria are met, an option (WithInt64Callback or\nWithFloat64Callback) can be used during the asynchronous instrument's\ncreation to register a callback (Int64Callback or Float64Callback,\nrespectively):\n\nIf the criteria are not met, use the RegisterCallback method of the Meter that\ncreated the instrument to register a Callback.\n\nThis package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy, all of its\ninterfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.\nThis non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation\nauthor.

This allows developers to\nextend Kubernetes with their own APIs that behave like core Kubernetes APIs, complete\nwith typed clients, authentication, authorization, and discovery.\n\nThe `apiserver` library is composed of several key packages:\n\nThe `GenericAPIServer` struct is the heart of any extension server. It is responsible\nfor assembling and running the HTTP serving stack. See the runnable example for a\ndemonstration of how to instantiate a `GenericAPIServer`.\n\nThe mechanism that enables extension API servers is API aggregation. The\nprimary apiserver (typically the kube-apiserver) acts as a proxy, forwarding\nrequests for a specific API group (e.g., /apis/myextension.io/v1) to a\nregistered extension server. The apiserver is configured using\nAPIService objects.\n\nFor most use cases, custom resources (CustomResourceDefinitions) are the\npreferred way to extend the Kubernetes API.\n\nThe `pkg/admission` package provides a way to add admission policies directly\ninto an apiserver. Admission plugins can be used to validate or mutate objects\nduring write operations. The kube-apiserver uses admission plugins to provide\na variety of core system capabilities.\n\nFor most extension use cases dynamic admission control using policies\n(ValidatingAdmissionPolicies or MutatingAdmissionPolicies) or\nwebhooks (ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and MutatingWebhookConfiguration) are the\npreferred way to extend admission control.",
