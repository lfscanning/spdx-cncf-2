            "description": "Package cloud is the root of the packages used to access Google Cloud\nServices. See https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go#section-directories for a\nfull list of sub-modules.\n\nAll clients in sub-packages are configurable via client options. These options\nare described here: https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/option.\n\nEndpoint configuration is used to specify the URL to which requests are\nsent. It is used for services that support or require regional endpoints, as\nwell as for other use cases such as testing against fake servers.\n\nFor example, the Vertex AI service recommends that you configure the endpoint to\nthe location with the features you want that is closest to your physical\nlocation or the location of your users. There is no global endpoint for Vertex\nAI. See Vertex AI - Locations for more details. The following example\ndemonstrates configuring a Vertex AI client with a regional endpoint:\n\nAll of the clients support authentication via Google Application Default Credentials,\nor by providing a JSON key file for a Service Account. See examples below.\n\nGoogle Application Default Credentials (ADC) is the recommended way to authorize\nand authenticate clients. For information on how to create and obtain\nApplication Default Credentials, see\nhttps://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production. If you have your\nenvironment configured correctly you will not need to pass any extra information\nto the client libraries. Here is an example of a client using ADC to\nauthenticate:\n\nYou can use a file with credentials to authenticate and authorize, such as a\nJSON key file associated with a Google service account. Service Account keys can\nbe created and downloaded from https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts.\nThis example uses the Secret Manger client, but the same steps apply to the\nall other client libraries this package as well. Example:\n\nIn some cases (for instance, you don't want to store secrets on disk), you can\ncreate credentials from in-memory JSON and use the WithCredentials option.\nThis example uses the Secret Manager client, but the same steps apply to\nall other client libraries as well. Note that scopes can be\nfound at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes, and\nare also provided in all auto-generated libraries: for example,\ncloud.google.com/go/secretmanager/apiv1 provides DefaultAuthScopes. Example:\n\nBy default, non-streaming methods, like Create or Get, will have a default\ndeadline applied to the context provided at call time, unless a context deadline\nis already set. Streaming methods have no default deadline and will run\nindefinitely. To set timeouts or arrange for cancellation, use\ncontext. Transient errors will be retried when correctness allows.\n\nHere is an example of setting a timeout for an RPC using\ncontext.WithTimeout:\n\nHere is an example of setting a timeout for an RPC using\ngithub.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2.WithTimeout:\n\nHere is an example of how to arrange for an RPC to be canceled, use\ncontext.WithCancel:\n\nDo not attempt to control the initial connection (dialing) of a service by\nsetting a timeout on the context passed to NewClient. Dialing is non-blocking,\nso timeouts would be ineffective and would only interfere with credential\nrefreshing, which uses the same context.\n\nRegardless of which transport is used, request headers can be set in the same\nway using [`callctx.SetHeaders`]setheaders.\n\nHere is a generic example:\n\nThere are a some header keys that Google reserves for internal use that must\nnot be ovewritten. The following header keys are broadly considered reserved\nand should not be conveyed by client library users unless instructed to do so:\n\n* `x-goog-api-client`\n* `x-goog-request-params`\n\nBe sure to check the individual package documentation for other service-specific\nreserved headers. For example, Storage supports a specific auditing header that\nis mentioned in that [module's documentation]storagedocs.\n\nGoogle Cloud services respect system parameterssystem parameters that can be\nused to augment request and/or response behavior. For the most part, they are\nnot needed when using one of the enclosed client libraries. However, those that\nmay be necessary are made available via the [`callctx`]callctx package. If not\npresent there, consider opening an issue on that repo to request a new constant.\n\nConnection pooling differs in clients based on their transport. Cloud\nclients either rely on HTTP or gRPC transports to communicate\nwith Google Cloud.\n\nCloud clients that use HTTP rely on the underlying HTTP transport to cache\nconnections for later re-use. These are cached to the http.MaxIdleConns\nand http.MaxIdleConnsPerHost settings in http.DefaultTransport by default.\n\nFor gRPC clients, connection pooling is configurable. Users of Cloud Client\nLibraries may specify google.golang.org/api/option.WithGRPCConnectionPool\nas a client option to NewClient calls.

            "description": "Package cloud is the root of the packages used to access Google Cloud\nServices. See https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go#section-directories for a\nfull list of sub-modules.\n\nAll clients in sub-packages are configurable via client options. These options\nare described here: https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/option.\n\nEndpoint configuration is used to specify the URL to which requests are\nsent. It is used for services that support or require regional endpoints, as\nwell as for other use cases such as testing against fake servers.\n\nFor example, the Vertex AI service recommends that you configure the endpoint to\nthe location with the features you want that is closest to your physical\nlocation or the location of your users. There is no global endpoint for Vertex\nAI. See Vertex AI - Locations for more details. The following example\ndemonstrates configuring a Vertex AI client with a regional endpoint:\n\nAll of the clients support authentication via Google Application Default Credentials,\nor by providing a JSON key file for a Service Account. See examples below.\n\nGoogle Application Default Credentials (ADC) is the recommended way to authorize\nand authenticate clients. For information on how to create and obtain\nApplication Default Credentials, see\nhttps://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production. If you have your\nenvironment configured correctly you will not need to pass any extra information\nto the client libraries. Here is an example of a client using ADC to\nauthenticate:\n\nYou can use a file with credentials to authenticate and authorize, such as a\nJSON key file associated with a Google service account. Service Account keys can\nbe created and downloaded from https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts.\nThis example uses the Secret Manger client, but the same steps apply to the\nall other client libraries this package as well. Example:\n\nIn some cases (for instance, you don't want to store secrets on disk), you can\ncreate credentials from in-memory JSON and use the WithCredentials option.\nThis example uses the Secret Manager client, but the same steps apply to\nall other client libraries as well. Note that scopes can be\nfound at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes, and\nare also provided in all auto-generated libraries: for example,\ncloud.google.com/go/secretmanager/apiv1 provides DefaultAuthScopes. Example:\n\nBy default, non-streaming methods, like Create or Get, will have a default\ndeadline applied to the context provided at call time, unless a context deadline\nis already set. Streaming methods have no default deadline and will run\nindefinitely. To set timeouts or arrange for cancellation, use\ncontext. Transient errors will be retried when correctness allows.\n\nHere is an example of setting a timeout for an RPC using\ncontext.WithTimeout:\n\nHere is an example of setting a timeout for an RPC using\ngithub.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2.WithTimeout:\n\nHere is an example of how to arrange for an RPC to be canceled, use\ncontext.WithCancel:\n\nDo not attempt to control the initial connection (dialing) of a service by\nsetting a timeout on the context passed to NewClient. Dialing is non-blocking,\nso timeouts would be ineffective and would only interfere with credential\nrefreshing, which uses the same context.\n\nRegardless of which transport is used, request headers can be set in the same\nway using [`callctx.SetHeaders`]setheaders.\n\nHere is a generic example:\n\nThere are a some header keys that Google reserves for internal use that must\nnot be ovewritten. The following header keys are broadly considered reserved\nand should not be conveyed by client library users unless instructed to do so:\n\n* `x-goog-api-client`\n* `x-goog-request-params`\n\nBe sure to check the individual package documentation for other service-specific\nreserved headers. For example, Storage supports a specific auditing header that\nis mentioned in that [module's documentation]storagedocs.\n\nGoogle Cloud services respect system parameterssystem parameters that can be\nused to augment request and/or response behavior. For the most part, they are\nnot needed when using one of the enclosed client libraries. However, those that\nmay be necessary are made available via the [`callctx`]callctx package. If not\npresent there, consider opening an issue on that repo to request a new constant.\n\nConnection pooling differs in clients based on their transport. Cloud\nclients either rely on HTTP or gRPC transports to communicate\nwith Google Cloud.\n\nCloud clients that use HTTP rely on the underlying HTTP transport to cache\nconnections for later re-use. These are cached to the http.MaxIdleConns\nand http.MaxIdleConnsPerHost settings in http.DefaultTransport by default.\n\nFor gRPC clients, connection pooling is configurable. Users of Cloud Client\nLibraries may specify google.golang.org/api/option.WithGRPCConnectionPool\nas a client option to NewClient calls. This configures the underlying gRPC\nconnections to be pooled and accessed in a round robin fashion.\n\nMinimal container images like Alpine lack CA certificates. This causes RPCs to\nappear to hang, because gRPC retries indefinitely. See\nhttps://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/928 for more information.\n\nFor tips on how to write tests against code that calls into our libraries check\nout our Debugging Guide.\n\nFor tips on how to write tests against code that calls into our libraries check\nout our Testing Guide.\n\nMost of the errors returned by the generated clients are wrapped in an\ngithub.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2/apierror.APIError and can be further unwrapped\ninto a google.golang.org/grpc/status.Status or\ngoogle.golang.org/api/googleapi.Error depending on the transport used to make\nthe call (gRPC or REST).

Clients should be\nreused instead of created as needed. The methods of Client are safe for\nconcurrent use by multiple goroutines.\n\nYou may configure the client by passing in options from the google.golang.org/api/option\npackage. You may also use options defined in this package, such as WithJSONReads.\n\nIf you only wish to access public data, you can create\nan unauthenticated client with\n\nTo use an emulator with this library, you can set the STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST\nenvironment variable to the address at which your emulator is running. This will\nsend requests to that address instead of to Cloud Storage. You can then create\nand use a client as usual:\n\nPlease note that there is no official emulator for Cloud Storage.\n\nA Google Cloud Storage bucket is a collection of objects. To work with a\nbucket, make a bucket handle:\n\nA handle is a reference to a bucket. You can have a handle even if the\nbucket doesn't exist yet. To create a bucket in Google Cloud Storage,\ncall BucketHandle.Create:\n\nNote that although buckets are associated with projects, bucket names are\nglobal across all projects.\n\nEach bucket has associated metadata, represented in this package by\nBucketAttrs. The third argument to BucketHandle.Create allows you to set\nthe initial BucketAttrs of a bucket. To retrieve a bucket's attributes, use\nBucketHandle.Attrs:\n\nAn object holds arbitrary data as a sequence of bytes, like a file. You\nrefer to objects using a handle, just as with buckets, but unlike buckets\nyou don't explicitly create an object. Instead, the first time you write\nto an object it will be created. You can use the standard Go io.Reader\nand io.Writer interfaces to read and write object data:\n\nObjects also have attributes, which you can fetch with ObjectHandle.Attrs:\n\nListing objects in a bucket is done with the BucketHandle.Objects method:\n\nObjects are listed lexicographically by name. To filter objects\nlexicographically, [Query.StartOffset] and/or [Query.EndOffset] can be used:\n\nIf only a subset of object attributes is needed when listing, specifying this\nsubset using Query.SetAttrSelection may speed up the listing process:\n\nBoth objects and buckets have ACLs (Access Control Lists). An ACL is a list of\nACLRules, each of which specifies the role of a user, group or project. ACLs\nare suitable for fine-grained control, but you may prefer using IAM to control\naccess at the project level (see Cloud Storage IAM docs.\n\nTo list the ACLs of a bucket or object, obtain an ACLHandle and call ACLHandle.List:\n\nYou can also set and delete ACLs.\n\nEvery object has a generation and a metageneration. The generation changes\nwhenever the content changes, and the metageneration changes whenever the\nmetadata changes. Conditions let you check these values before an operation;\nthe operation only executes if the conditions match. You can use conditions to\nprevent race conditions in read-modify-write operations.\n\nFor example, say you've read an object's metadata into objAttrs. Now\nyou want to write to that object, but only if its contents haven't changed\nsince you read it. Here is how to express that:\n\nYou can obtain a URL that lets anyone read or write an object for a limited time.\nSigning a URL requires credentials authorized to sign a URL. To use the same\nauthentication that was used when instantiating the Storage client, use\nBucketHandle.SignedURL.\n\nYou can also sign a URL without creating a client. See the documentation of\nSignedURL for details.\n\nA type of signed request that allows uploads through HTML forms directly to Cloud Storage with\ntemporary permission. Conditions can be applied to restrict how the HTML form is used and exercised\nby a user.\n\nFor more information, please see the XML POST Object docs as well\nas the documentation of BucketHandle.GenerateSignedPostPolicyV4.\n\nIf the GoogleAccessID and PrivateKey option fields are not provided, they will\nbe automatically detected by BucketHandle.SignedURL and\nBucketHandle.GenerateSignedPostPolicyV4 if any of the following are true:\n\nDetecting GoogleAccessID may not be possible if you are authenticated using a\ntoken source or using option.WithHTTPClient. In this case, you can provide a\nservice account email for GoogleAccessID and the client will attempt to sign\nthe URL or Post Policy using that service account.\n\nTo generate the signature, you must have:\n\nErrors returned by this client are often of the type github.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2/apierror.\nThe [apierror.APIError] type can wrap a google.golang.org/grpc/status.Status\nif gRPC was used, or a google.golang.org/api/googleapi.Error if HTTP/REST was used.\nYou might also encounter googleapi.Error directly from HTTP operations.\nThese types of errors can be inspected for more information by using errors.As\nto access the specific underlying error types and retrieve detailed information,\nincluding HTTP or gRPC status codes. For example:\n\nThis library may also return other errors that are not wrapped as [apierror.APIError]. For\nexample, errors with authentication may return cloud.google.com/go/auth.Error.\n\nMethods in this package may retry calls that fail with transient errors.\nRetrying continues indefinitely unless the controlling context is canceled, the\nclient is closed, or a non-transient error is received. To stop retries from\ncontinuing, use context timeouts or cancellation.\n\nThe retry strategy in this library follows best practices for Cloud Storage. By\ndefault, operations are retried only if they are idempotent, and exponential\nbackoff with jitter is employed. In addition, errors are only retried if they\nare defined as transient by the service. See the Cloud Storage retry docs\nfor more information.\n\nUsers can configure non-default retry behavior for a single library call (using\nBucketHandle.Retryer and ObjectHandle.Retryer) or for all calls made by a\nclient (using Client.SetRetry). For example:\n\nYou can add custom headers to any API call made by this package by using\ncallctx.SetHeaders on the context which is passed to the method. For example,\nto add a custom audit logging header:\n\nThis package includes support for the Cloud Storage gRPC API. This\nimplementation uses gRPC rather than the default JSON & XML APIs\nto make requests to Cloud Storage. All methods on the Client support\nthe gRPC API, with the exception of the Client.ServiceAccount, Notification,\nand HMACKey methods.\n\nThe Cloud Storage gRPC API is generally available.\n\nTo create a client which will use gRPC, use the alternate constructor:\n\nOne major advantage of the gRPC API is that it can use Direct Connectivity,\nenabling requests to skip some proxy steps and reducing response latency.\nRequirements to use Direct Connectivity include:\n\nAdditional requirements for Direct Connectivity are documented in the\nCloud Storage gRPC docs. If all requirements are met, the client will\nuse Direct Connectivity by default without requiring any client options\nor environment variables. To disable Direct Connectivity, you can set\nthe environment variable GOOGLE_CLOUD_DISABLE_DIRECT_PATH=true.\n\nDependencies for the gRPC API may slightly increase the size of binaries for\napplications depending on this package. If you are not using gRPC, you can use\nthe build tag `disable_grpc_modules` to opt out of these dependencies and\nreduce the binary size.\n\nThe gRPC client is instrumented with Open Telemetry metrics which export to\nCloud Monitoring by default. More information is available in the\ngRPC client-side metrics documentation, including information about\nroles which must be enabled in order to do the export successfully. To\ndisable this export, you can use the WithDisabledClientMetrics client\noption.\n\nThe gRPC client automatically computes and sends CRC32C checksums for uploads using Writer,\nwhich provides an additional layer of data integrity validation when compared to the HTTP client.\nThis behavior can optionally be disabled by using [Writer.DisableAutoChecksum].\n\nCertain control plane and long-running operations for Cloud Storage (including Folder\nand Managed Folder operations) are supported via the autogenerated Storage Control\nclient, which is available as a subpackage in this module.

Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

            "description": "Package template implements data-driven templates for generating textual output.\n\nTo generate HTML output, see package html/template, which has the same interface\nas this package but automatically secures HTML output against certain attacks.\n\nTemplates are executed by applying them to a data structure. Annotations in the\ntemplate refer to elements of the data structure (typically a field of a struct\nor a key in a map) to control execution and derive values to be displayed.\nExecution of the template walks the structure and sets the cursor, represented\nby a period '.' and called \"dot\", to the value at the current location in the\nstructure as execution proceeds.\n\nThe input text for a template is UTF-8-encoded text in any format.\n\"Actions\"--data evaluations or control structures--are delimited by\n\"{{\" and \"}}\"; all text outside actions is copied to the output unchanged.\nActions may not span newlines, although comments can.\n\nOnce parsed, a template may be executed safely in parallel.\n\nHere is a trivial example that prints \"17 items are made of wool\".\n\nMore intricate examples appear below.\n\nHere is the list of actions. \"Arguments\" and \"pipelines\" are evaluations of\ndata, defined in detail below.\n\nAn argument is a simple value, denoted by one of the following.\n\nArguments may evaluate to any type; if they are pointers the implementation\nautomatically indirects to the base type when required.\nIf an evaluation yields a function value, such as a function-valued\nfield of a struct, the function is not invoked automatically, but it\ncan be used as a truth value for an if action and the like. To invoke\nit, use the call function, defined below.\n\nA pipeline is a possibly chained sequence of \"commands\". A command is a simple\nvalue (argument) or a function or method call, possibly with multiple arguments:\n\nA pipeline may be \"chained\" by separating a sequence of commands with pipeline\ncharacters '|'. In a chained pipeline, the result of the each command is\npassed as the last argument of the following command. The output of the final\ncommand in the pipeline is the value of the pipeline.\n\nThe output of a command will be either one value or two values, the second of\nwhich has type error. If that second value is present and evaluates to\nnon-nil, execution terminates and the error is returned to the caller of\nExecute.\n\nA pipeline inside an action may initialize a variable to capture the result.\nThe initialization has syntax\n\nwhere $variable is the name of the variable. An action that declares a\nvariable produces no output.\n\nIf a \"range\" action initializes a variable, the variable is set to the\nsuccessive elements of the iteration.  Also, a \"range\" may declare two\nvariables, separated by a comma:\n\nin which case $index and $element are set to the successive values of the\narray/slice index or map key and element, respectively.  Note that if there is\nonly one variable, it is assigned the element; this is opposite to the\nconvention in Go range clauses.\n\nA variable's scope extends to the \"end\" action of the control structure (\"if\",\n\"with\", or \"range\") in which it is declared, or to the end of the template if\nthere is no such control structure.  A template invocation does not inherit\nvariables from the point of its invocation.\n\nWhen execution begins, $ is set to the data argument passed to Execute, that is,\nto the starting value of dot.\n\nHere are some example one-line templates demonstrating pipelines and variables.\nAll produce the quoted word \"output\":\n\nDuring execution functions are found in two function maps: first in the\ntemplate, then in the global function map. By default, no functions are defined\nin the template but the Funcs method can be used to add them.\n\nPredefined global functions are named as follows.\n\nThe boolean functions take any zero value to be false and a non-zero\nvalue to be true.\n\nThere is also a set of binary comparison operators defined as\nfunctions:\n\nFor simpler multi-way equality tests, eq (only) accepts two or more\narguments and compares the second and subsequent to the first,\nreturning in effect\n\n(Unlike with || in Go, however, eq is a function call and all the\narguments will be evaluated.)\n\nThe comparison functions work on basic types only (or named basic\ntypes, such as \"type Celsius float32\"). They implement the Go rules\nfor comparison of values, except that size and exact type are\nignored, so any integer value, signed or unsigned, may be compared\nwith any other integer value. (The arithmetic value is compared,\nnot the bit pattern, so all negative integers are less than all\nunsigned integers.) However, as usual, one may not compare an int\nwith a float32 and so on.\n\nEach template is named by a string specified when it is created. Also, each\ntemplate is associated with zero or more other templates that it may invoke by\nname; such associations are transitive and form a name space of templates.\n\nA template may use a template invocation to instantiate another associated\ntemplate; see the explanation of the \"template\" action above. The name must be\nthat of a template associated with the template that contains the invocation.\n\nWhen parsing a template, another template may be defined and associated with the\ntemplate being parsed. Template definitions must appear at the top level of the\ntemplate, much like global variables in a Go program.\n\nThe syntax of such definitions is to surround each template declaration with a\n\"define\" and \"end\" action.\n\nThe define action names the template being created by providing a string\nconstant. Here is a simple example:\n\nThis defines two templates, T1 and T2, and a third T3 that invokes the other two\nwhen it is executed. Finally it invokes T3. If executed this template will\nproduce the text\n\nBy construction, a template may reside in only one association. If it's\nnecessary to have a template addressable from multiple associations, the\ntemplate definition must be parsed multiple times to create distinct *Template\nvalues, or must be copied with the Clone or AddParseTree method.\n\nParse may be called multiple times to assemble the various associated templates;\nsee the ParseFiles and ParseGlob functions and methods for simple ways to parse\nrelated templates stored in files.\n\nA template may be executed directly or through ExecuteTemplate, which executes\nan associated template identified by name. To invoke our example above, we\nmight write,\n\nor to invoke a particular template explicitly by name,",

Annotations in the\ntemplate refer to elements of the data structure (typically a field of a struct\nor a key in a map) to control execution and derive values to be displayed.\nExecution of the template walks the structure and sets the cursor, represented\nby a period '.' and called \"dot\", to the value at the current location in the\nstructure as execution proceeds.\n\nThe input text for a template is UTF-8-encoded text in any format.\n\"Actions\"--data evaluations or control structures--are delimited by\n\"{{\" and \"}}\"; all text outside actions is copied to the output unchanged.\nActions may not span newlines, although comments can.\n\nOnce parsed, a template may be executed safely in parallel.\n\nHere is a trivial example that prints \"17 items are made of wool\".\n\nMore intricate examples appear below.\n\nHere is the list of actions. \"Arguments\" and \"pipelines\" are evaluations of\ndata, defined in detail below.\n\nAn argument is a simple value, denoted by one of the following.\n\nArguments may evaluate to any type; if they are pointers the implementation\nautomatically indirects to the base type when required.\nIf an evaluation yields a function value, such as a function-valued\nfield of a struct, the function is not invoked automatically, but it\ncan be used as a truth value for an if action and the like. To invoke\nit, use the call function, defined below.\n\nA pipeline is a possibly chained sequence of \"commands\". A command is a simple\nvalue (argument) or a function or method call, possibly with multiple arguments:\n\nA pipeline may be \"chained\" by separating a sequence of commands with pipeline\ncharacters '|'. In a chained pipeline, the result of the each command is\npassed as the last argument of the following command. The output of the final\ncommand in the pipeline is the value of the pipeline.\n\nThe output of a command will be either one value or two values, the second of\nwhich has type error. If that second value is present and evaluates to\nnon-nil, execution terminates and the error is returned to the caller of\nExecute.\n\nA pipeline inside an action may initialize a variable to capture the result.\nThe initialization has syntax\n\nwhere $variable is the name of the variable. An action that declares a\nvariable produces no output.\n\nIf a \"range\" action initializes a variable, the variable is set to the\nsuccessive elements of the iteration.  Also, a \"range\" may declare two\nvariables, separated by a comma:\n\nin which case $index and $element are set to the successive values of the\narray/slice index or map key and element, respectively.  Note that if there is\nonly one variable, it is assigned the element; this is opposite to the\nconvention in Go range clauses.\n\nA variable's scope extends to the \"end\" action of the control structure (\"if\",\n\"with\", or \"range\") in which it is declared, or to the end of the template if\nthere is no such control structure.  A template invocation does not inherit\nvariables from the point of its invocation.\n\nWhen execution begins, $ is set to the data argument passed to Execute, that is,\nto the starting value of dot.\n\nHere are some example one-line templates demonstrating pipelines and variables.\nAll produce the quoted word \"output\":\n\nDuring execution functions are found in two function maps: first in the\ntemplate, then in the global function map. By default, no functions are defined\nin the template but the Funcs method can be used to add them.\n\nPredefined global functions are named as follows.\n\nThe boolean functions take any zero value to be false and a non-zero\nvalue to be true.\n\nThere is also a set of binary comparison operators defined as\nfunctions:\n\nFor simpler multi-way equality tests, eq (only) accepts two or more\narguments and compares the second and subsequent to the first,\nreturning in effect\n\n(Unlike with || in Go, however, eq is a function call and all the\narguments will be evaluated.)\n\nThe comparison functions work on basic types only (or named basic\ntypes, such as \"type Celsius float32\"). They implement the Go rules\nfor comparison of values, except that size and exact type are\nignored, so any integer value, signed or unsigned, may be compared\nwith any other integer value. (The arithmetic value is compared,\nnot the bit pattern, so all negative integers are less than all\nunsigned integers.) However, as usual, one may not compare an int\nwith a float32 and so on.\n\nEach template is named by a string specified when it is created. Also, each\ntemplate is associated with zero or more other templates that it may invoke by\nname; such associations are transitive and form a name space of templates.\n\nA template may use a template invocation to instantiate another associated\ntemplate; see the explanation of the \"template\" action above. The name must be\nthat of a template associated with the template that contains the invocation.\n\nWhen parsing a template, another template may be defined and associated with the\ntemplate being parsed. Template definitions must appear at the top level of the\ntemplate, much like global variables in a Go program.\n\nThe syntax of such definitions is to surround each template declaration with a\n\"define\" and \"end\" action.\n\nThe define action names the template being created by providing a string\nconstant. Here is a simple example:\n\nThis defines two templates, T1 and T2, and a third T3 that invokes the other two\nwhen it is executed. Finally it invokes T3. If executed this template will\nproduce the text\n\nBy construction, a template may reside in only one association. If it's\nnecessary to have a template addressable from multiple associations, the\ntemplate definition must be parsed multiple times to create distinct *Template\nvalues, or must be copied with the Clone or AddParseTree method.\n\nParse may be called multiple times to assemble the various associated templates;\nsee the ParseFiles and ParseGlob functions and methods for simple ways to parse\nrelated templates stored in files.\n\nA template may be executed directly or through ExecuteTemplate, which executes\nan associated template identified by name. To invoke our example above, we\nmight write,\n\nor to invoke a particular template explicitly by name,",

Use this as a reference of the Go types\nincluded with the SDK, such as AWS clients, API operations, and API parameters.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/\n\nThe SDK is composed of two main components, SDK core, and service clients.\nThe SDK core packages are all available under the aws package at the root of\nthe SDK. Each client for a supported AWS service is available within its own\npackage under the service folder at the root of the SDK.\n\naws - SDK core, provides common shared types such as Config, Logger,\nand utilities to make working with API parameters easier.\n\nawserr - Provides the error interface that the SDK will use for all\nerrors that occur in the SDK's processing. This includes service API\nresponse errors as well. The Error type is made up of a code and message.\nCast the SDK's returned error type to awserr.Error and call the Code\nmethod to compare returned error to specific error codes.

Constants are also provided\nfor all region identifiers, e.g UsWest2RegionID for \"us-west-2\".\n\nsession - Provides initial default configuration, and load\nconfiguration from external sources such as environment and shared\ncredentials file.\n\nrequest - Provides the API request sending, and retry logic for the SDK.\nThis package also includes utilities for defining your own request\nretryer, and configuring how the SDK processes the request.\n\nservice - Clients for AWS services. All services supported by the SDK are\navailable under this folder.\n\nThe SDK includes the Go types and utilities you can use to make requests to\nAWS service APIs. Within the service folder at the root of the SDK you'll find\na package for each AWS service the SDK supports. All service clients follows\na common pattern of creation and usage.\n\nWhen creating a client for an AWS service you'll first need to have a Session\nvalue constructed. The Session provides shared configuration that can be shared\nbetween your service clients. When service clients are created you can pass\nin additional configuration via the aws.Config type to override configuration\nprovided by in the Session to create service client instances with custom\nconfiguration.\n\nOnce the service's client is created you can use it to make API requests the\nAWS service. These clients are safe to use concurrently.\n\nIn the AWS SDK for Go, you can configure settings for service clients, such\nas the log level and maximum number of retries. Most settings are optional;\nhowever, for each service client, you must specify a region and your credentials.\nThe SDK uses these values to send requests to the correct AWS region and sign\nrequests with the correct credentials. You can specify these values as part\nof a session or as environment variables.\n\nSee the SDK's configuration guide for more information.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html\n\nSee the session package documentation for more information on how to use Session\nwith the SDK.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/\n\nSee the Config type in the aws package for more information on configuration\noptions.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/#Config\n\nWhen using the SDK you'll generally need your AWS credentials to authenticate\nwith AWS services. The SDK supports multiple methods of supporting these\ncredentials. By default the SDK will source credentials automatically from\nits default credential chain. See the session package for more information\non this chain, and how to configure it. The common items in the credential\nchain are the following:\n\nEnvironment Credentials - Set of environment variables that are useful\nwhen sub processes are created for specific roles.\n\nShared Credentials file (~/.aws/credentials) - This file stores your\ncredentials based on a profile name and is useful for local development.\n\nEC2 Instance Role Credentials - Use EC2 Instance Role to assign credentials\nto application running on an EC2 instance. This removes the need to manage\ncredential files in production.\n\nCredentials can be configured in code as well by setting the Config's Credentials\nvalue to a custom provider or using one of the providers included with the\nSDK to bypass the default credential chain and use a custom one. This is\nhelpful when you want to instruct the SDK to only use a specific set of\ncredentials or providers.\n\nThis example creates a credential provider for assuming an IAM role, \"myRoleARN\"\nand configures the S3 service client to use that role for API requests.\n\nSee the credentials package documentation for more information on credential\nproviders included with the SDK, and how to customize the SDK's usage of\ncredentials.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/credentials\n\nThe SDK has support for the shared configuration file (~/.aws/config). This\nsupport can be enabled by setting the environment variable, \"AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1\",\nor enabling the feature in code when creating a Session via the\nOption's SharedConfigState parameter.\n\nIn addition to the credentials you'll need to specify the region the SDK\nwill use to make AWS API requests to. In the SDK you can specify the region\neither with an environment variable, or directly in code when a Session or\nservice client is created. The last value specified in code wins if the region\nis specified multiple ways.\n\nTo set the region via the environment variable set the \"AWS_REGION\" to the\nregion you want to the SDK to use. Using this method to set the region will\nallow you to run your application in multiple regions without needing additional\ncode in the application to select the region.\n\nThe endpoints package includes constants for all regions the SDK knows. The\nvalues are all suffixed with RegionID. These values are helpful, because they\nreduce the need to type the region string manually.\n\nTo set the region on a Session use the aws package's Config struct parameter\nRegion to the AWS region you want the service clients created from the session to\nuse. This is helpful when you want to create multiple service clients, and\nall of the clients make API requests to the same region.\n\nSee the endpoints package for the AWS Regions and Endpoints metadata.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/endpoints/\n\nIn addition to setting the region when creating a Session you can also set\nthe region on a per service client bases. This overrides the region of a\nSession. This is helpful when you want to create service clients in specific\nregions different from the Session's region.\n\nSee the Config type in the aws package for more information and additional\noptions such as setting the Endpoint, and other service client configuration options.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/#Config\n\nOnce the client is created you can make an API request to the service.\nEach API method takes a input parameter, and returns the service response\nand an error. The SDK provides methods for making the API call in multiple ways.\n\nIn this list we'll use the S3 ListObjects API as an example for the different\nways of making API requests.\n\nListObjects - Base API operation that will make the API request to the service.\n\nListObjectsRequest - API methods suffixed with Request will construct the\nAPI request, but not send it. This is also helpful when you want to get a\npresigned URL for a request, and share the presigned URL instead of your\napplication making the request directly.\n\nListObjectsPages - Same as the base API operation, but uses a callback to\nautomatically handle pagination of the API's response.\n\nListObjectsWithContext - Same as base API operation, but adds support for\nthe Context pattern. This is helpful for controlling the canceling of in\nflight requests. See the Go standard library context package for more\ninformation. This method also takes request package's Option functional\noptions as the variadic argument for modifying how the request will be\nmade, or extracting information from the raw HTTP response.\n\nListObjectsPagesWithContext - same as ListObjectsPages, but adds support for\nthe Context pattern. Similar to ListObjectsWithContext this method also\ntakes the request package's Option function option types as the variadic\nargument.\n\nIn addition to the API operations the SDK also includes several higher level\nmethods that abstract checking for and waiting for an AWS resource to be in\na desired state. In this list we'll use WaitUntilBucketExists to demonstrate\nthe different forms of waiters.\n\nWaitUntilBucketExists. - Method to make API request to query an AWS service for\na resource's state. Will return successfully when that state is accomplished.\n\nWaitUntilBucketExistsWithContext - Same as WaitUntilBucketExists, but adds\nsupport for the Context pattern. In addition these methods take request\npackage's WaiterOptions to configure the waiter, and how underlying request\nwill be made by the SDK.\n\nThe API method will document which error codes the service might return for\nthe operation. These errors will also be available as const strings prefixed\nwith \"ErrCode\" in the service client's package. If there are no errors listed\nin the API's SDK documentation you'll need to consult the AWS service's API\ndocumentation for the errors that could be returned.\n\nPagination helper methods are suffixed with \"Pages\", and provide the\nfunctionality needed to round trip API page requests. Pagination methods\ntake a callback function that will be called for each page of the API's response.\n\nWaiter helper methods provide the functionality to wait for an AWS resource\nstate. These methods abstract the logic needed to to check the state of an\nAWS resource, and wait until that resource is in a desired state. The waiter\nwill block until the resource is in the state that is desired, an error occurs,\nor the waiter times out. If a resource times out the error code returned will\nbe request.WaiterResourceNotReadyErrorCode.\n\nThis example shows a complete working Go file which will upload a file to S3\nand use the Context pattern to implement timeout logic that will cancel the\nrequest if it takes too long. This example highlights how to use sessions,\ncreate a service client, make a request, handle the error, and process the\nresponse.\n\nDeprecated: aws-sdk-go is deprecated.

Use this as a reference of the Go types\nincluded with the SDK, such as AWS clients, API operations, and API parameters.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/\n\nThe SDK is composed of two main components, SDK core, and service clients.\nThe SDK core packages are all available under the aws package at the root of\nthe SDK. Each client for a supported AWS service is available within its own\npackage under the service folder at the root of the SDK.\n\naws - SDK core, provides common shared types such as Config, Logger,\nand utilities to make working with API parameters easier.\n\nawserr - Provides the error interface that the SDK will use for all\nerrors that occur in the SDK's processing. This includes service API\nresponse errors as well. The Error type is made up of a code and message.\nCast the SDK's returned error type to awserr.Error and call the Code\nmethod to compare returned error to specific error codes. See the package's\ndocumentation for additional values that can be extracted such as RequestId.\n\ncredentials - Provides the types and built in credentials providers\nthe SDK will use to retrieve AWS credentials to make API requests with.\nNested under this folder are also additional credentials providers such as\nstscreds for assuming IAM roles, and ec2rolecreds for EC2 Instance roles.\n\nendpoints - Provides the AWS Regions and Endpoints metadata for the SDK.\nUse this to lookup AWS service endpoint information such as which services\nare in a region, and what regions a service is in. Constants are also provided\nfor all region identifiers, e.g UsWest2RegionID for \"us-west-2\".\n\nsession - Provides initial default configuration, and load\nconfiguration from external sources such as environment and shared\ncredentials file.\n\nrequest - Provides the API request sending, and retry logic for the SDK.\nThis package also includes utilities for defining your own request\nretryer, and configuring how the SDK processes the request.\n\nservice - Clients for AWS services. All services supported by the SDK are\navailable under this folder.\n\nThe SDK includes the Go types and utilities you can use to make requests to\nAWS service APIs. Within the service folder at the root of the SDK you'll find\na package for each AWS service the SDK supports. All service clients follows\na common pattern of creation and usage.\n\nWhen creating a client for an AWS service you'll first need to have a Session\nvalue constructed. The Session provides shared configuration that can be shared\nbetween your service clients. When service clients are created you can pass\nin additional configuration via the aws.Config type to override configuration\nprovided by in the Session to create service client instances with custom\nconfiguration.\n\nOnce the service's client is created you can use it to make API requests the\nAWS service. These clients are safe to use concurrently.\n\nIn the AWS SDK for Go, you can configure settings for service clients, such\nas the log level and maximum number of retries. Most settings are optional;\nhowever, for each service client, you must specify a region and your credentials.\nThe SDK uses these values to send requests to the correct AWS region and sign\nrequests with the correct credentials. You can specify these values as part\nof a session or as environment variables.\n\nSee the SDK's configuration guide for more information.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html\n\nSee the session package documentation for more information on how to use Session\nwith the SDK.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/\n\nSee the Config type in the aws package for more information on configuration\noptions.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/#Config\n\nWhen using the SDK you'll generally need your AWS credentials to authenticate\nwith AWS services. The SDK supports multiple methods of supporting these\ncredentials. By default the SDK will source credentials automatically from\nits default credential chain. See the session package for more information\non this chain, and how to configure it. The common items in the credential\nchain are the following:\n\nEnvironment Credentials - Set of environment variables that are useful\nwhen sub processes are created for specific roles.\n\nShared Credentials file (~/.aws/credentials) - This file stores your\ncredentials based on a profile name and is useful for local development.\n\nEC2 Instance Role Credentials - Use EC2 Instance Role to assign credentials\nto application running on an EC2 instance. This removes the need to manage\ncredential files in production.\n\nCredentials can be configured in code as well by setting the Config's Credentials\nvalue to a custom provider or using one of the providers included with the\nSDK to bypass the default credential chain and use a custom one. This is\nhelpful when you want to instruct the SDK to only use a specific set of\ncredentials or providers.\n\nThis example creates a credential provider for assuming an IAM role, \"myRoleARN\"\nand configures the S3 service client to use that role for API requests.\n\nSee the credentials package documentation for more information on credential\nproviders included with the SDK, and how to customize the SDK's usage of\ncredentials.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/credentials\n\nThe SDK has support for the shared configuration file (~/.aws/config). This\nsupport can be enabled by setting the environment variable, \"AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1\",\nor enabling the feature in code when creating a Session via the\nOption's SharedConfigState parameter.\n\nIn addition to the credentials you'll need to specify the region the SDK\nwill use to make AWS API requests to. In the SDK you can specify the region\neither with an environment variable, or directly in code when a Session or\nservice client is created. The last value specified in code wins if the region\nis specified multiple ways.\n\nTo set the region via the environment variable set the \"AWS_REGION\" to the\nregion you want to the SDK to use. Using this method to set the region will\nallow you to run your application in multiple regions without needing additional\ncode in the application to select the region.\n\nThe endpoints package includes constants for all regions the SDK knows. The\nvalues are all suffixed with RegionID. These values are helpful, because they\nreduce the need to type the region string manually.\n\nTo set the region on a Session use the aws package's Config struct parameter\nRegion to the AWS region you want the service clients created from the session to\nuse. This is helpful when you want to create multiple service clients, and\nall of the clients make API requests to the same region.\n\nSee the endpoints package for the AWS Regions and Endpoints metadata.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/endpoints/\n\nIn addition to setting the region when creating a Session you can also set\nthe region on a per service client bases. This overrides the region of a\nSession. This is helpful when you want to create service clients in specific\nregions different from the Session's region.\n\nSee the Config type in the aws package for more information and additional\noptions such as setting the Endpoint, and other service client configuration options.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/#Config\n\nOnce the client is created you can make an API request to the service.\nEach API method takes a input parameter, and returns the service response\nand an error. The SDK provides methods for making the API call in multiple ways.\n\nIn this list we'll use the S3 ListObjects API as an example for the different\nways of making API requests.\n\nListObjects - Base API operation that will make the API request to the service.\n\nListObjectsRequest - API methods suffixed with Request will construct the\nAPI request, but not send it. This is also helpful when you want to get a\npresigned URL for a request, and share the presigned URL instead of your\napplication making the request directly.\n\nListObjectsPages - Same as the base API operation, but uses a callback to\nautomatically handle pagination of the API's response.\n\nListObjectsWithContext - Same as base API operation, but adds support for\nthe Context pattern. This is helpful for controlling the canceling of in\nflight requests. See the Go standard library context package for more\ninformation. This method also takes request package's Option functional\noptions as the variadic argument for modifying how the request will be\nmade, or extracting information from the raw HTTP response.\n\nListObjectsPagesWithContext - same as ListObjectsPages, but adds support for\nthe Context pattern. Similar to ListObjectsWithContext this method also\ntakes the request package's Option function option types as the variadic\nargument.\n\nIn addition to the API operations the SDK also includes several higher level\nmethods that abstract checking for and waiting for an AWS resource to be in\na desired state. In this list we'll use WaitUntilBucketExists to demonstrate\nthe different forms of waiters.\n\nWaitUntilBucketExists. - Method to make API request to query an AWS service for\na resource's state. Will return successfully when that state is accomplished.\n\nWaitUntilBucketExistsWithContext - Same as WaitUntilBucketExists, but adds\nsupport for the Context pattern. In addition these methods take request\npackage's WaiterOptions to configure the waiter, and how underlying request\nwill be made by the SDK.\n\nThe API method will document which error codes the service might return for\nthe operation. These errors will also be available as const strings prefixed\nwith \"ErrCode\" in the service client's package. If there are no errors listed\nin the API's SDK documentation you'll need to consult the AWS service's API\ndocumentation for the errors that could be returned.\n\nPagination helper methods are suffixed with \"Pages\", and provide the\nfunctionality needed to round trip API page requests. Pagination methods\ntake a callback function that will be called for each page of the API's response.\n\nWaiter helper methods provide the functionality to wait for an AWS resource\nstate. These methods abstract the logic needed to to check the state of an\nAWS resource, and wait until that resource is in a desired state. The waiter\nwill block until the resource is in the state that is desired, an error occurs,\nor the waiter times out. If a resource times out the error code returned will\nbe request.WaiterResourceNotReadyErrorCode.\n\nThis example shows a complete working Go file which will upload a file to S3\nand use the Context pattern to implement timeout logic that will cancel the\nrequest if it takes too long. This example highlights how to use sessions,\ncreate a service client, make a request, handle the error, and process the\nresponse.\n\nDeprecated: aws-sdk-go is deprecated.

            "description": "Package restful , a lean package for creating REST-style WebServices without magic.\n\n### WebServices and Routes\n\nA WebService has a collection of Route objects that dispatch incoming Http Requests to a function calls.\nTypically, a WebService has a root path (e.g. /users) and defines common MIME types for its routes.\nWebServices must be added to a container (see below) in order to handler Http requests from a server.\n\nA Route is defined by a HTTP method, an URL path and (optionally) the MIME types it consumes (Content-Type) and produces (Accept).\nThis package has the logic to find the best matching Route and if found, call its Function.\n\nThe (*Request, *Response) arguments provide functions for reading information from the request and writing information back to the response.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/user-resource/restful-user-resource.go with a full implementation.\n\n### Regular expression matching Routes\n\nA Route parameter can be specified using the format \"uri/{var[:regexp]}\" or the special version \"uri/{var:*}\" for matching the tail of the path.\nFor example, /persons/{name:[A-Z][A-Z]} can be used to restrict values for the parameter \"name\" to only contain capital alphabetic characters.\nRegular expressions must use the standard Go syntax as described in the regexp package. (https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\n### Containers\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\n### Filters\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\n### Container Filters\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\n### WebService Filters\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\n### Route Filters\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\n### Response Encoding\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\n### OPTIONS support\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\n### CORS\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUnexpected things happen. If a request cannot be processed because of a failure, your service needs to tell via the response what happened and why.\nFor this reason HTTP status codes exist and it is important to use the correct code in every exceptional situation.\n\nIf path or query parameters are not valid (content or type) then use http.StatusBadRequest.\n\nDespite a valid URI, the resource requested may not be available\n\nIf the application logic could not process the request (or write the response) then use http.StatusInternalServerError.\n\nThe request has a valid URL but the method (GET,PUT,POST,...) is not allowed.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Accept Header set for this operation.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Content-Type Header set for this operation.\n\n### ServiceError\n\nIn addition to setting the correct (error) Http status code, you can choose to write a ServiceError message on the response.\n\n### Performance options\n\nThis package has several options that affect the performance of your service. It is important to understand them and how you can change it.\n\nDoNotRecover controls whether panics will be caught to return HTTP 500.\nIf set to false, the container will recover from panics.\nDefault value is true\n\nIf content encoding is enabled then the default strategy for getting new gzip/zlib writers and readers is to use a sync.Pool.\nBecause writers are expensive structures, performance is even more improved when using a preloaded cache. You can also inject your own implementation.\n\n### Trouble shooting\n\nThis package has the means to produce detail logging of the complete Http request matching process and filter invocation.\nEnabling this feature requires you to set an implementation of restful.StdLogger (e.g. log.Logger) instance such as:\n\n### Logging\n\nThe restful.SetLogger() method allows you to override the logger used by the package. By default restful\nuses the standard library `log` package and logs to stdout. Different logging packages are supported as\nlong as they conform to `StdLogger` interface defined in the `log` sub-package, writing an adapter for your\npreferred package is simple.\n\n### Resources\n\n(c) 2012-2025, http://ernestmicklei.com.

And\n\"keyasint\" makes a field encode to an element of CBOR map with specified int key.\n\nLatest docs can be viewed at https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#cbor-library-in-go\n\nThe Quick Start guide is at https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#quick-start\n\nFunction signatures identical to encoding/json include:\n\nStandard interfaces include:\n\nDiagnostic functions translate CBOR data item into Diagnostic Notation:\n\nFunctions that simplify using CBOR Sequences (RFC 8742) include:\n\nCustom encoding and decoding is possible by implementing standard interfaces for\nuser-defined Go types.\n\nCodec functions are available at package-level (using defaults options) or by\ncreating modes from options at runtime.\n\n\"Mode\" in this API means definite way of encoding (EncMode) or decoding (DecMode).\n\nEncMode and DecMode interfaces are created from EncOptions or DecOptions structs.\n\nModes use immutable options to avoid side-effects and simplify concurrency. Behavior of\nmodes won't accidentally change at runtime after they're created.\n\nModes are intended to be reused and are safe for concurrent use.\n\nEncMode and DecMode Interfaces\n\nUsing Default Encoding Mode\n\nUsing Default Decoding Mode\n\nUsing Default Mode of UnmarshalFirst to Decode CBOR Sequences\n\nUsing Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN) to represent CBOR data\n\nCreating and Using Encoding Modes\n\nPredefined Encoding Options: https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#predefined-encoding-options\n\nEncoding Options: https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#encoding-options\n\nDecoding Options: https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#decoding-options\n\nStruct tags like `cbor:\"name,omitempty\"` and `json:\"name,omitempty\"` work as expected.\nIf both struct tags are specified then `cbor` is used.\n\nStruct tag options like \"keyasint\", \"toarray\", \"omitempty\", and \"omitzero\" make it easy to use\nvery compact formats like COSE and CWT (CBOR Web Tokens) with structs.\n\nThe \"omitzero\" option omits zero values from encoding, matching\n[stdlib encoding/json behavior](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Marshal).\nWhen specified in the `cbor` tag, the option is always honored.\nWhen specified in the `json` tag, the option is honored when building with Go 1.24+.\n\nFor example, \"toarray\" makes struct fields encode to array elements.  And \"keyasint\"\nmakes struct fields encode to elements of CBOR map with int keys.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxamacker/images/master/cbor/v2.0.0/cbor_easy_api.png\n\nStruct tag options are listed at https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#struct-tags-1\n\nOver 375 tests are included in this package.

Packages in the Go ecosystem can depend on this package,\nwhile callers can implement logging with whatever backend is appropriate.\n\nLogging is done using a Logger instance.  Logger is a concrete type with\nmethods, which defers the actual logging to a LogSink interface.  The main\nmethods of Logger are Info() and Error().  Arguments to Info() and Error()\nare key/value pairs rather than printf-style formatted strings, emphasizing\n\"structured logging\".\n\nWith Go's standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr's structured logging, we'd write:\n\nErrors are much the same.  Instead of:\n\nWe'd write:\n\nInfo() and Error() are very similar, but they are separate methods so that\nLogSink implementations can choose to do things like attach additional\ninformation (such as stack traces) on calls to Error(). Error() messages are\nalways logged, regardless of the current verbosity.  If there is no error\ninstance available, passing nil is valid.\n\nOften we want to log information only when the application in \"verbose\nmode\".  To write log lines that are more verbose, Logger has a V() method.\nThe higher the V-level of a log line, the less critical it is considered.\nLog-lines with V-levels that are not enabled (as per the LogSink) will not\nbe written.  Level V(0) is the default, and logger.V(0).Info() has the same\nmeaning as logger.Info().  Negative V-levels have the same meaning as V(0).\nError messages do not have a verbosity level and are always logged.\n\nWhere we might have written:\n\nWe can write:\n\nLogger instances can have name strings so that all messages logged through\nthat instance have additional context.  For example, you might want to add\na subsystem name:\n\nThe WithName() method returns a new Logger, which can be passed to\nconstructors or other functions for further use.  Repeated use of WithName()\nwill accumulate name \"segments\".  These name segments will be joined in some\nway by the LogSink implementation.  It is strongly recommended that name\nsegments contain simple identifiers (letters, digits, and hyphen), and do\nnot contain characters that could muddle the log output or confuse the\njoining operation (e.g. whitespace, commas, periods, slashes, brackets,\nquotes, etc).\n\nLogger instances can store any number of key/value pairs, which will be\nlogged alongside all messages logged through that instance.  For example,\nyou might want to create a Logger instance per managed object:\n\nWith the standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr we'd write:\n\nLogger has very few hard rules, with the goal that LogSink implementations\nmight have a lot of freedom to differentiate.  There are, however, some\nthings to consider.\n\nThe log message consists of a constant message attached to the log line.\nThis should generally be a simple description of what's occurring, and should\nnever be a format string.  Variable information can then be attached using\nnamed values.\n\nKeys are arbitrary strings, but should generally be constant values.  Values\nmay be any Go value, but how the value is formatted is determined by the\nLogSink implementation.\n\nLogger instances are meant to be passed around by value. Code that receives\nsuch a value can call its methods without having to check whether the\ninstance is ready for use.\n\nThe zero logger (= Logger{}) is identical to Discard() and discards all log\nentries. Code that receives a Logger by value can simply call it, the methods\nwill never crash. For cases where passing a logger is optional, a pointer to Logger\nshould be used.\n\nKeys are not strictly required to conform to any specification or regex, but\nit is recommended that they:\n\nThese guidelines help ensure that log data is processed properly regardless\nof the log implementation.  For example, log implementations will try to\noutput JSON data or will store data for later database (e.g. SQL) queries.\n\nWhile users are generally free to use key names of their choice, it's\ngenerally best to avoid using the following keys, as they're frequently used\nby implementations:\n\nImplementations are encouraged to make use of these keys to represent the\nabove concepts, when necessary (for example, in a pure-JSON output form, it\nwould be necessary to represent at least message and timestamp as ordinary\nnamed values).\n\nImplementations may choose to give callers access to the underlying\nlogging implementation.  The recommended pattern for this is:\n\nLogger grants access to the sink to enable type assertions like this:\n\nCustom `With*` functions can be implemented by copying the complete\nLogger struct and replacing the sink in the copy:\n\nDon't use New to construct a new Logger with a LogSink retrieved from an\nexisting Logger. Source code attribution might not work correctly and\nunexported fields in Logger get lost.\n\nBeware that the same LogSink instance may be shared by different logger\ninstances. Calling functions that modify the LogSink will affect all of\nthose.",

            "description": "Package mapstructure exposes functionality to convert one arbitrary\nGo type into another, typically to convert a map[string]any\ninto a native Go structure.\n\nThe Go structure can be arbitrarily complex, containing slices,\nother structs, etc. and the decoder will properly decode nested\nmaps and so on into the proper structures in the native Go struct.\nSee the examples to see what the decoder is capable of.\n\nThe simplest function to start with is Decode.\n\nWhen decoding to a struct, mapstructure will use the field name by\ndefault to perform the mapping. For example, if a struct has a field\n\"Username\" then mapstructure will look for a key in the source value\nof \"username\" (case insensitive).\n\nYou can change the behavior of mapstructure by using struct tags.\nThe default struct tag that mapstructure looks for is \"mapstructure\"\nbut you can customize it using DecoderConfig.\n\nTo rename the key that mapstructure looks for, use the \"mapstructure\"\ntag and set a value directly. For example, to change the \"username\" example\nabove to \"user\":\n\nEmbedded structs are treated as if they're another field with that name.\nBy default, the two structs below are equivalent when decoding with\nmapstructure:\n\nThis would require an input that looks like below:\n\nIf your \"person\" value is NOT nested, then you can append \",squash\" to\nyour tag value and mapstructure will treat it as if the embedded struct\nwere part of the struct directly. Example:\n\nNow the following input would be accepted:\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to a map, the squash tag squashes the struct\nfields into a single map. Using the example structs from above:\n\nWill be decoded into a map:\n\nDecoderConfig has a field that changes the behavior of mapstructure\nto always squash embedded structs.\n\nIf there are any unmapped keys in the source value, mapstructure by\ndefault will silently ignore them. You can error by setting ErrorUnused\nin DecoderConfig. If you're using Metadata you can also maintain a slice\nof the unused keys.\n\nYou can also use the \",remain\" suffix on your tag to collect all unused\nvalues in a map. The field with this tag MUST be a map type and should\nprobably be a \"map[string]any\" or \"map[any]any\".\nSee example below:\n\nGiven the input below, Other would be populated with the other\nvalues that weren't used (everything but \"name\"):\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitempty\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to\nthe zero value, or a zero-length element. The zero value of all types is\nspecified in the Go specification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type. And likewise for the URLs field, if the\nslice is nil or empty, it won't be encoded into the destination type.\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitzero\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to the zero\nvalue. The zero value of all types is specified in the Go specification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type. And likewise for the URLs field, if the\nslice is nil, it won't be encoded into the destination type.\n\nNote that if the field is a slice, and it is empty but not nil, it will\nstill be encoded into the destination type.\n\nSince unexported (private) struct fields cannot be set outside the package\nwhere they are defined, the decoder will simply skip them.\n\nFor this output type definition:\n\nUsing this map as input:\n\nThe following struct will be decoded:\n\nTypes can implement the Unmarshaler interface to control their own decoding. The interface\nbehaves similarly to how UnmarshalJSON does in the standard library. It can be used as an\nalternative or companion to a DecodeHook.\n\nSee the Unmarshaler interface documentation for more details.\n\nmapstructure is highly configurable. See the DecoderConfig struct\nfor other features and options that are supported.",

            "description": "Package mux implements a request router and dispatcher.\n\nThe name mux stands for \"HTTP request multiplexer\". Like the standard\nhttp.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of\nregistered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL\nor other conditions. The main features are:\n\nLet's start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:\n\nHere we register three routes mapping URL paths to handlers. This is\nequivalent to how http.HandleFunc() works: if an incoming request URL matches\none of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passing\n(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) as parameters.\n\nPaths can have variables. They are defined using the format {name} or\n{name:pattern}. If a regular expression pattern is not defined, the matched\nvariable will be anything until the next slash. For example:\n\nGroups can be used inside patterns, as long as they are non-capturing (?:re). For example:\n\nThe names are used to create a map of route variables which can be retrieved\ncalling mux.Vars():\n\nNote that if any capturing groups are present, mux will panic() during parsing. To prevent\nthis, convert any capturing groups to non-capturing, e.g. change \"/{sort:(asc|desc)}\" to\n\"/{sort:(?:asc|desc)}\". This is a change from prior versions which behaved unpredictably\nwhen capturing groups were present.\n\nAnd this is all you need to know about the basic usage. More advanced options\nare explained below.\n\nRoutes can also be restricted to a domain or subdomain. Just define a host\npattern to be matched. They can also have variables:\n\nThere are several other matchers that can be added. To match path prefixes:\n\n...or HTTP methods:\n\n...or URL schemes:\n\n...or header values:\n\n...or query values:\n\n...or to use a custom matcher function:\n\n...and finally, it is possible to combine several matchers in a single route:\n\nSetting the same matching conditions again and again can be boring, so we have\na way to group several routes that share the same requirements.\nWe call it \"subrouting\".\n\nFor example, let's say we have several URLs that should only match when the\nhost is \"www.example.com\". Create a route for that host and get a \"subrouter\"\nfrom it:\n\nThen register routes in the subrouter:\n\nThe three URL paths we registered above will only be tested if the domain is\n\"www.example.com\", because the subrouter is tested first. This is not\nonly convenient, but also optimizes request matching. You can create\nsubrouters combining any attribute matchers accepted by a route.\n\nSubrouters can be used to create domain or path \"namespaces\": you define\nsubrouters in a central place and then parts of the app can register its\npaths relatively to a given subrouter.\n\nThere's one more thing about subroutes. When a subrouter has a path prefix,\nthe inner routes use it as base for their paths:\n\nNote that the path provided to PathPrefix() represents a \"wildcard\": calling\nPathPrefix(\"/static/\").Handler(...) means that the handler will be passed any\nrequest that matches \"/static/*\". This makes it easy to serve static files with mux:\n\nNow let's see how to build registered URLs.\n\nRoutes can be named. All routes that define a name can have their URLs built,\nor \"reversed\". We define a name calling Name() on a route. For example:\n\nTo build a URL, get the route and call the URL() method, passing a sequence of\nkey/value pairs for the route variables.

For more information\nabout this property, see https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html\nor any book about automata theory.\n\nAll characters are UTF-8-encoded code points.\nFollowing utf8.DecodeRune, each byte of an invalid UTF-8 sequence\nis treated as if it encoded utf8.RuneError (U+FFFD).\n\nThere are 16 methods of Regexp that match a regular expression and identify\nthe matched text. Their names are matched by this regular expression:\n\nIf 'All' is present, the routine matches successive non-overlapping\nmatches of the entire expression. Empty matches abutting a preceding\nmatch are ignored. The return value is a slice containing the successive\nreturn values of the corresponding non-'All' routine. These routines take\nan extra integer argument, n. If n >= 0, the function returns at most n\nmatches/submatches; otherwise, it returns all of them.\n\nIf 'String' is present, the argument is a string; otherwise it is a slice\nof bytes; return values are adjusted as appropriate.\n\nIf 'Submatch' is present, the return value is a slice identifying the\nsuccessive submatches of the expression. Submatches are matches of\nparenthesized subexpressions (also known as capturing groups) within the\nregular expression, numbered from left to right in order of opening\nparenthesis. Submatch 0 is the match of the entire expression, submatch 1 is\nthe match of the first parenthesized subexpression, and so on.\n\nIf 'Index' is present, matches and submatches are identified by byte index\npairs within the input string: result[2*n:2*n+2] identifies the indexes of\nthe nth submatch.

However, the\nupstream gRPC codebase is relatively bare bones.\n\nThis package, and most of its child packages provides commonly needed middleware for gRPC:\nclient-side interceptors for retires, server-side interceptors for input validation and auth,\nfunctions for chaining said interceptors, metadata convenience methods and more.\n\nSimple way of turning a multiple interceptors into a single interceptor. Here's an example for\nserver chaining:\n\nThese interceptors will be executed from left to right: logging, monitoring and auth.\n\nHere's an example for client side chaining:\n\nThese interceptors will be executed from left to right: monitoring and then retry logic.\n\nThe retry interceptor will call every interceptor that follows it whenever when a retry happens.\n\nImplementing your own interceptor is pretty trivial: there are interfaces for that. But the interesting\nbit exposing common data to handlers (and other middleware), similarly to HTTP Middleware design.\nFor example, you may want to pass the identity of the caller from the auth interceptor all the way\nto the handling function.\n\nFor example, a client side interceptor example for auth looks like:\n\nUnfortunately, it's not as easy for streaming RPCs.

            "description": "A helper to merge structs and maps in Golang. Useful for configuration default values, avoiding messy if-statements.\n\nMergo merges same-type structs and maps by setting default values in zero-value fields. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields. It will do recursively any exported one. It also won't merge structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nIt is ready for production use. It is used in several projects by Docker, Google, The Linux Foundation, VMWare, Shopify, etc.\n\nPlease keep in mind that a problematic PR broke 0.3.9. We reverted it in 0.3.10. We consider 0.3.10 as stable but not bug-free. . Also, this version adds suppot for go modules.\n\nKeep in mind that in 0.3.2, Mergo changed Merge() and Map() signatures to support transformers. We added an optional/variadic argument so that it won't break the existing code.\n\nIf you were using Mergo before April 6th, 2015, please check your project works as intended after updating your local copy with go get -u github.com/imdario/mergo. I apologize for any issue caused by its previous behavior and any future bug that Mergo could cause in existing projects after the change (release 0.2.0).\n\nDo your usual installation procedure:\n\nYou can only merge same-type structs with exported fields initialized as zero value of their type and same-types maps. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields but will do recursively any exported one. It won't merge empty structs value as they are zero values too. Also, maps will be merged recursively except for structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nAlso, you can merge overwriting values using the transformer WithOverride.\n\nAdditionally, you can map a map[string]interface{} to a struct (and otherwise, from struct to map), following the same restrictions as in Merge(). Keys are capitalized to find each corresponding exported field.\n\nWarning: if you map a struct to map, it won't do it recursively. Don't expect Mergo to map struct members of your struct as map[string]interface{}. They will be just assigned as values.\n\nHere is a nice example:\n\nTransformers allow to merge specific types differently than in the default behavior. In other words, now you can customize how some types are merged. For example, time.Time is a struct; it doesn't have zero value but IsZero can return true because it has fields with zero value. How can we merge a non-zero time.Time?\n\nIf I can help you, you have an idea or you are using Mergo in your projects, don't hesitate to drop me a line (or a pull request): https://twitter.com/im_dario\n\nWritten by Dario Casta\u00f1\u00e9: https://da.rio.hn\n\nBSD 3-Clause license, as Go language.",

            "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

            "description": "Package pq is a Go PostgreSQL driver for database/sql.\n\nMost clients will use the database/sql package instead of using this package\ndirectly. For example:\n\nYou can also connect with an URL:\n\nSee NewConfig.\n\ndatabase/sql does not dictate any specific format for parameter placeholders,\nand pq uses the PostgreSQL-native ordinal markers ($1, $2, etc.). The same\nplaceholder can be used more than once:\n\npq does not support sql.Result.LastInsertId. Use the RETURNING clause with a\nQuery or QueryRow call instead to return the identifier:\n\nParameters pass through driver.DefaultParameterConverter before they are handled\nby this package. When the binary_parameters connection option is enabled, []byte\nvalues are sent directly to the backend as data in binary format.\n\nThis package returns the following types for values from the PostgreSQL backend:\n\nAll other types are returned directly from the backend as []byte values in text format.\n\npq may return errors of type *pq.Error which contain error details:\n\nYou can perform bulk imports by preparing a statement returned by CopyIn (or\nCopyInSchema) in an explicit transaction (sql.Tx). The returned statement\nhandle can then be repeatedly \"executed\" to copy data into the target table.\nAfter all data has been processed you should call Exec() once with no arguments\nto flush all buffered data. Any call to Exec() might return an error which\nshould be handled appropriately, but because of the internal buffering an error\nreturned by Exec() might not be related to the data passed in the call that\nfailed.\n\nCopyIn uses COPY FROM internally. It is not possible to COPY outside of an\nexplicit transaction in pq.\n\nPostgreSQL supports a simple publish/subscribe model using PostgreSQL's NOTIFY mechanism.\n\nTo start listening for notifications, you first have to open a new connection to\nthe database by calling NewListener. This connection can not be used for\nanything other than LISTEN / NOTIFY. Calling Listen will open a \"notification\nchannel\"; once a notification channel is open, a notification generated on that\nchannel will effect a send on the Listener.Notify channel. A notification\nchannel will remain open until Unlisten is called, though connection loss might\nresult in some notifications being lost. To solve this problem, Listener sends a\nnil pointer over the Notify channel any time the connection is re-established\nfollowing a connection loss. The application can get information about the state\nof the underlying connection by setting an event callback in the call to\nNewListener.\n\nA single Listener can safely be used from concurrent goroutines, which means\nthat there is often no need to create more than one Listener in your\napplication. However, a Listener is always connected to a single database, so\nyou will need to create a new Listener instance for every database you want to\nreceive notifications in.\n\nThe channel name in both Listen and Unlisten is case sensitive, and can contain\nany characters legal in an identifier. Note that the channel name will be\ntruncated to 63 bytes by the PostgreSQL server.\n\nYou can find a complete, working example of Listener usage at cmd/pqlisten.\n\nIf you need support for Kerberos authentication, add the following to your main\npackage:\n\nThis package is in a separate module so that users who don't need Kerberos don't\nhave to add unnecessary dependencies.",

The package allows\ncomplete control over what is sent out to the DNS.

A DNS message consists\nout of four sections.\nThe question section: in.Question, the answer section: in.Answer,\nthe authority section: in.Ns and the additional section: in.Extra.\n\nEach of these sections (except the Question section) contain a []RR.

Back slashes and quotations marks will\nbe escaped. Bytes below 32 and above 127 will be converted to \\DDD form.\n\nFor domain names, in addition to the above rules brackets, periods, spaces,\nsemicolons and the at symbol are escaped.\n\nDNSSEC (DNS Security Extension) adds a layer of security to the DNS. It uses\npublic key cryptography to sign resource records. The public keys are stored in\nDNSKEY records and the signatures in RRSIG records.\n\nRequesting DNSSEC information for a zone is done by adding the DO (DNSSEC OK)\nbit to a request.\n\nSignature generation, signature verification and key generation are all supported.\n\nDynamic updates reuses the DNS message format, but renames three of the\nsections. Question is Zone, Answer is Prerequisite, Authority is Update, only\nthe Additional is not renamed. See RFC 2136 for the gory details.\n\nYou can set a rather complex set of rules for the existence of absence of\ncertain resource records or names in a zone to specify if resource records\nshould be added or removed. The table from RFC 2136 supplemented with the Go\nDNS function shows which functions exist to specify the prerequisites.\n\nThe prerequisite section can also be left empty. If you have decided on the\nprerequisites you can tell what RRs should be added or deleted. The next table\nshows the options you have and what functions to call.\n\nAn TSIG or transaction signature adds a HMAC TSIG record to each message sent.\nThe supported algorithms include: HmacSHA1, HmacSHA256 and HmacSHA512.\n\nBasic use pattern when querying with a TSIG name \"axfr.\" (note that these key names\nmust be fully qualified - as they are domain names) and the base64 secret\n\"so6ZGir4GPAqINNh9U5c3A==\":\n\nIf an incoming message contains a TSIG record it MUST be the last record in\nthe additional section (RFC2845 3.2).  This means that you should make the\ncall to SetTsig last, right before executing the query.  If you make any\nchanges to the RRset after calling SetTsig() the signature will be incorrect.\n\nWhen requesting an zone transfer (almost all TSIG usage is when requesting zone\ntransfers), with TSIG, this is the basic use pattern. In this example we\nrequest an AXFR for miek.nl. with TSIG key named \"axfr.\" and secret\n\"so6ZGir4GPAqINNh9U5c3A==\" and using the server 176.58.119.54:\n\nYou can now read the records from the transfer as they come in.

This requires additional code to\nperform any session establishment and signature generation/verification. The\nclient must be configured with an implementation of the TsigProvider interface:\n\nBasic use pattern validating and replying to a message that has TSIG set.\n\nRFC 6895 sets aside a range of type codes for private use. This range is 65,280\n- 65,534 (0xFF00 - 0xFFFE). When experimenting with new Resource Records these\ncan be used, before requesting an official type code from IANA.\n\nSee https://miek.nl/2014/september/21/idn-and-private-rr-in-go-dns/ for more\ninformation.\n\nEDNS0 is an extension mechanism for the DNS defined in RFC 2671 and updated by\nRFC 6891.

Each has methods that help improve\nthe encoding/decoding performance of some binary\nprotocols.\n\nThe Writer and Reader type provide similar\nfunctionality to their counterparts in bufio, plus\na few extra utility methods that simplify read-ahead\nand write-ahead. I wrote this package to improve serialization\nperformance for http://github.com/tinylib/msgp,\nwhere it provided about a 2x speedup over `bufio` for certain\nworkloads. However, care must be taken to understand the semantics of the\nextra methods provided by this package, as they allow\nthe user to access and manipulate the buffer memory\ndirectly.\n\nThe extra methods for Reader are Reader.Peek, Reader.Skip\nand Reader.Next. (*fwd.Reader).Peek, unlike (*bufio.Reader).Peek,\nwill re-allocate the read buffer in order to accommodate arbitrarily\nlarge read-ahead. (*fwd.Reader).Skip skips the next 'n' bytes\nin the stream, and uses the io.Seeker interface if the underlying\nstream implements it. (*fwd.Reader).Next returns a slice pointing\nto the next 'n' bytes in the read buffer (like Reader.Peek), but also\nincrements the read position. This allows users to process streams\nin arbitrary block sizes without having to manage appropriately-sized\nslices. Additionally, obviating the need to copy the data from the\nbuffer to another location in memory can improve performance dramatically\nin CPU-bound applications.\n\nWriter only has one extra method, which is (*fwd.Writer).Next, which\nreturns a slice pointing to the next 'n' bytes of the writer, and increments\nthe write position by the length of the returned slice. This allows users\nto write directly to the end of the buffer.",

            "description": "Package cuckoo provides a Cuckoo Filter, a Bloom filter replacement for approximated set-membership queries.\n\nWhile Bloom filters are well-known space-efficient data structures to serve queries like \"if item x is in a set?\", they do not support deletion. Their variances to enable deletion (like counting Bloom filters) usually require much more space.\n\nCuckoo filters provide the \ufb02exibility to add and remove items dynamically. A cuckoo filter is based on cuckoo hashing (and therefore named as cuckoo filter). It is essentially a cuckoo hash table storing each key's fingerprint. Cuckoo hash tables can be highly compact, thus a cuckoo filter could use less space than conventional Bloom \ufb01lters, for applications that require low false positive rates (< 3%).\n\nFor details about the algorithm and citations please use this article:\n\n\"Cuckoo Filter: Better Than Bloom\" by Bin Fan, Dave Andersen and Michael Kaminsky\n(https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf)\n\nNote:\nThis implementation uses a a static bucket size of 4 fingerprints and a fingerprint size of 1 byte based on my understanding of an optimal bucket/fingerprint/size ratio from the aforementioned paper.",

See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html\n\nUsage:\n\npflag is a drop-in replacement of Go's native flag package. If you import\npflag under the name \"flag\" then all code should continue to function\nwith no changes.\n\nThere is one exception to this: if you directly instantiate the Flag struct\nthere is one more field \"Shorthand\" that you will need to set.\nMost code never instantiates this struct directly, and instead uses\nfunctions such as String(), BoolVar(), and Var(), and is therefore\nunaffected.\n\nDefine flags using flag.String(), Bool(), Int(), etc.\n\nThis declares an integer flag, -flagname, stored in the pointer ip, with type *int.\n\nIf you like, you can bind the flag to a variable using the Var() functions.\n\nOr you can create custom flags that satisfy the Value interface (with\npointer receivers) and couple them to flag parsing by\n\nFor such flags, the default value is just the initial value of the variable.\n\nAfter all flags are defined, call\n\nto parse the command line into the defined flags.\n\nFlags may then be used directly. If you're using the flags themselves,\nthey are all pointers; if you bind to variables, they're values.\n\nAfter parsing, the arguments after the flag are available as the\nslice flag.Args() or individually as flag.Arg(i).\nThe arguments are indexed from 0 through flag.NArg()-1.\n\nThe pflag package also defines some new functions that are not in flag,\nthat give one-letter shorthands for flags. You can use these by appending\n'P' to the name of any function that defines a flag.\n\nShorthand letters can be used with single dashes on the command line.\nBoolean shorthand flags can be combined with other shorthand flags.\n\nCommand line flag syntax:\n\nUnlike the flag package, a single dash before an option means something\ndifferent than a double dash. Single dashes signify a series of shorthand\nletters for flags. All but the last shorthand letter must be boolean flags.\n\nFlag parsing stops after the terminator \"--\". Unlike the flag package,\nflags can be interspersed with arguments anywhere on the command line\nbefore this terminator.\n\nInteger flags accept 1234, 0664, 0x1234 and may be negative.\nBoolean flags (in their long form) accept 1, 0, t, f, true, false,\nTRUE, FALSE, True, False.\nDuration flags accept any input valid for time.ParseDuration.\n\nThe default set of command-line flags is controlled by\ntop-level functions.  The FlagSet type allows one to define\nindependent sets of flags, such as to implement subcommands\nin a command-line interface. The methods of FlagSet are\nanalogous to the top-level functions for the command-line\nflag set.",

            "description": "Package metric provides the OpenTelemetry API used to measure metrics about\nsource code operation.\n\nThis API is separate from its implementation so the instrumentation built from\nit is reusable. See go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric for the official\nOpenTelemetry implementation of this API.\n\nAll measurements made with this package are made via instruments. These\ninstruments are created by a Meter which itself is created by a\nMeterProvider. Applications need to accept a MeterProvider implementation\nas a starting point when instrumenting. This can be done directly, or by using\nthe OpenTelemetry global MeterProvider via GetMeterProvider. Using an\nappropriately named Meter from the accepted MeterProvider, instrumentation\ncan then be built from the Meter's instruments.\n\nEach instrument is designed to make measurements of a particular type. Broadly,\nall instruments fall into two overlapping logical categories: asynchronous or\nsynchronous, and int64 or float64.\n\nAll synchronous instruments (Int64Counter, Int64UpDownCounter,\nInt64Histogram, Float64Counter, Float64UpDownCounter, and\nFloat64Histogram) are used to measure the operation and performance of source\ncode during the source code execution. These instruments only make measurements\nwhen the source code they instrument is run.\n\nAll asynchronous instruments (Int64ObservableCounter,\nInt64ObservableUpDownCounter, Int64ObservableGauge,\nFloat64ObservableCounter, Float64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) are used to measure metrics outside of the execution\nof source code. They are said to make \"observations\" via a callback function\ncalled once every measurement collection cycle.\n\nEach instrument is also grouped by the value type it measures. Either int64 or\nfloat64. The value being measured will dictate which instrument in these\ncategories to use.\n\nOutside of these two broad categories, instruments are described by the\nfunction they are designed to serve. All Counters (Int64Counter,\nFloat64Counter, Int64ObservableCounter, and Float64ObservableCounter) are\ndesigned to measure values that never decrease in value, but instead only\nincrementally increase in value. UpDownCounters (Int64UpDownCounter,\nFloat64UpDownCounter, Int64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableUpDownCounter) on the other hand, are designed to measure\nvalues that can increase and decrease. When more information needs to be\nconveyed about all the synchronous measurements made during a collection cycle,\na Histogram (Int64Histogram and Float64Histogram) should be used. Finally,\nwhen just the most recent measurement needs to be conveyed about an\nasynchronous measurement, a Gauge (Int64ObservableGauge and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) should be used.\n\nSee the OpenTelemetry documentation for more information about instruments\nand their intended use.\n\nOpenTelemetry defines an instrument name syntax that restricts what\ninstrument names are allowed.\n\nInstrument names should ...\n\nTo ensure compatibility with observability platforms, all instruments created\nneed to conform to this syntax. Not all implementations of the API will validate\nthese names, it is the callers responsibility to ensure compliance.\n\nMeasurements are made by recording values and information about the values with\nan instrument. How these measurements are recorded depends on the instrument.\n\nMeasurements for synchronous instruments (Int64Counter, Int64UpDownCounter,\nInt64Histogram, Float64Counter, Float64UpDownCounter, and\nFloat64Histogram) are recorded using the instrument methods directly. All\ncounter instruments have an Add method that is used to measure an increment\nvalue, and all histogram instruments have a Record method to measure a data\npoint.\n\nAsynchronous instruments (Int64ObservableCounter,\nInt64ObservableUpDownCounter, Int64ObservableGauge,\nFloat64ObservableCounter, Float64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) record measurements within a callback function. The\ncallback is registered with the Meter which ensures the callback is called once\nper collection cycle. A callback can be registered two ways: during the\ninstrument's creation using an option, or later using the RegisterCallback\nmethod of the Meter that created the instrument.\n\nIf the following criteria are met, an option (WithInt64Callback or\nWithFloat64Callback) can be used during the asynchronous instrument's\ncreation to register a callback (Int64Callback or Float64Callback,\nrespectively):\n\nIf the criteria are not met, use the RegisterCallback method of the Meter that\ncreated the instrument to register a Callback.\n\nThis package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy, all of its\ninterfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.\nThis non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation\nauthor. They could unknowingly build their implementation in a way that would\nresult in a runtime panic for their users that update to the new API.\n\nThe API is designed to help inform an instrumentation author about this\nnon-standard API evolution.

It is the\nobject that all API calls use to create Meters, instruments, and ultimately\nmake metric measurements. Also, it is an object that should be used to\ncontrol the life-cycle (start, flush, and shutdown) of the SDK.\n\nA MeterProvider needs to be configured to export the measured data, this is\ndone by configuring it with a Reader implementation (using the WithReader\nMeterProviderOption). Readers take two forms: ones that push to an endpoint\n(NewPeriodicReader), and ones that an endpoint pulls from. See\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters for exporters that can be used as\nor with these Readers.\n\nEach Reader, when registered with the MeterProvider, can be augmented with a\nView. Views allow users that run OpenTelemetry instrumented code to modify\nthe generated data of that instrumentation.\n\nThe data generated by a MeterProvider needs to include information about its\norigin. A MeterProvider needs to be configured with a Resource, using the\nWithResource MeterProviderOption, to include this information. This Resource\nshould be used to describe the unique runtime environment instrumented code\nis being run on. That way when multiple instances of the code are collected\nat a single endpoint their origin is decipherable.\n\nTo avoid leaking memory, the SDK returns the same instrument for calls to\ncreate new instruments with the same Name, Unit, and Description.\nImportantly, callbacks provided using metric.WithFloat64Callback or\nmetric.WithInt64Callback will only apply for the first instrument created\nwith a given Name, Unit, and Description. Instead, use\nMeter.RegisterCallback and Registration.Unregister to add and remove\ncallbacks without leaking memory.\n\nCardinality refers to the number of unique attributes collected. High cardinality can lead to\nexcessive memory usage, increased storage costs, and backend performance issues.\n\nCurrently, the OpenTelemetry Go Metric SDK does not enforce a cardinality limit by default\n(note that this may change in a future release). Use WithCardinalityLimit to set the\ncardinality limit as desired.\n\nNew attribute sets are dropped when the cardinality limit is reached. The measurement of\nthese sets are aggregated into\na special attribute set containing attribute.Bool(\"otel.metric.overflow\", true).\nThis ensures total metric values (e.g., Sum, Count) remain correct for the\ncollection cycle, but information about the specific dropped sets\nis not preserved.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nFor performance reasons, the SDK does not guarantee that the order in which\nsynchronous measurements are made to the SDK is reflected in the collected\nmetric data. This means that even when a single goroutine makes sequential\nsynchronous measurements, it is possible for a later measurement to be\nincluded in the collected metric data when an earlier measurement is not.\nThis applies to measurements made to different instruments, or to different\nattribute sets on the same instrument. Sequential measurements made to the\nsame instrument and with the same attributes are guaranteed to preserve\nordering with respect to collection.\n\nAdditionally, the SDK does not guarantee that exemplars are always included\nin the same batch of metric data as the measurement they are associated\nwith.\n\nSee go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric for more information about\nthe metric API.\n\nSee go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric/internal/x for information about\nthe experimental features.\n\nTo enable metrics in your application using the SDK,\nyou'll need to have an initialized MeterProvider\nthat will let you create a go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric.Meter.\n\nHere's how you might initialize a metrics provider.",

A controller observes the\nstate of the cluster and works to bring it to the desired state.\n\nThe `tools/cache` package provides the building blocks for this pattern.\nInformers watch the API server and maintain a local cache, Listers provide\nread-only access to the cache, and Workqueues decouple event detection\nfrom processing.\n\nIn a high-availability deployment where multiple instances of a controller\nare running, leader election (`tools/leaderelection`) is used to ensure\nthat only one instance is active at a time.\n\nClient-side feature gates allow for enabling or disabling experimental\nfeatures in `client-go`. They can be configured via the `rest.Config` object.",

Kirk Haines and I were\n     paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test\n     frameworks...\n\n     I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable\n     compared to the 'other two' options we looked at. Nicely done and\n     thank you for helping us keep our mental sanity.\"\n\n    -- Wayne E. Seguin\n\nminitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.\nIt provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and\nreadable.\n\nminitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto\nminitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec\nexpectations.\n\nminitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your\nalgorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb\nco-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential\none!\n\nminitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test\noutput. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P\n\nminitest/test is meant to have a clean implementation for language\nimplementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working\ntest suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case\ndiscovery.\n\n    \"Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing\n     framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!\"\n\n    -- Piotr Szotkowski\n\nComparing to rspec:\n\n    rspec is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.\n\n    -- Adam Hawkins, \"Bow Before MiniTest\"\n\nminitest doesn't reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like:\nclasses, modules, inheritance, methods. This means you only have to\nlearn ruby to use minitest and all of your regular OO practices like\nextract-method refactorings still apply.",
